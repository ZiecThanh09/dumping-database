For the reasons for this, see [HELP INSERT DELAYED],\n\nInserting into a table requires the INSERT privilege for the table. If\nthe ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE clause is used and a duplicate key causes\nan UPDATE to be performed instead, the statement requires the UPDATE\nprivilege for the columns to be updated. For columns that are read but\nnot modified you need only the SELECT privilege (such as for a column\nreferenced only on the right hand side of an col_name=expr assignment\nin an ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE clause).\n\nWhen inserting into a partitioned table, you can control which\npartitions and subpartitions accept new rows. The PARTITION clause\ntakes a list of the comma-separated names of one or more partitions or\nsubpartitions (or both) of the table. If any of the rows to be inserted\nby a given INSERT statement do not match one of the partitions listed,\nthe INSERT statement fails with the error Found a row not matching the\ngiven partition set.

Tags are matched based on the tag or attribute name and the\ncolumn name.\n\nThe following clauses work essentially the same way for LOAD XML as\nthey do for LOAD DATA:\n\no LOW_PRIORITY or CONCURRENT\n\no LOCAL\n\no REPLACE or IGNORE\n\no CHARACTER SET\n\no SET\n\nSee [HELP LOAD DATA], for more information about these clauses.\n\n(field_name_or_user_var, ...) is a list of one or more comma-separated\nXML fields or user variables.

The standard accepts only table_reference, not a list of\nthem inside a pair of parentheses.\n\nThis is a conservative extension if each comma in a list of\ntable_reference items is considered as equivalent to an inner join. For\nexample:\n\nSELECT * FROM t1 LEFT JOIN (t2, t3, t4)\n                 ON (t2.a = t1.a AND t3.b = t1.b AND t4.c = t1.c)\n\nis equivalent to:\n\nSELECT * FROM t1 LEFT JOIN (t2 CROSS JOIN t3 CROSS JOIN t4)\n                 ON (t2.a = t1.a AND t3.b = t1.b AND t4.c = t1.c)\n\nIn MySQL, JOIN, CROSS JOIN, and INNER JOIN are syntactic equivalents\n(they can replace each other). In standard SQL, they are not\nequivalent. INNER JOIN is used with an ON clause, CROSS JOIN is used\notherwise.\n\nIn general, parentheses can be ignored in join expressions containing\nonly inner join operations. MySQL also supports nested joins. See\nhttps://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.4/en/nested-join-optimization.html.\n\nIndex hints can be specified to affect how the MySQL optimizer makes\nuse of indexes.

The SET clause\nindicates which columns to modify and the values they should be given.\nEach value can be given as an expression, or the keyword DEFAULT to set\na column explicitly to its default value. The WHERE clause, if given,\nspecifies the conditions that identify which rows to update. With no\nWHERE clause, all rows are updated. If the ORDER BY clause is\nspecified, the rows are updated in the order that is specified. The\nLIMIT clause places a limit on the number of rows that can be updated.\n\nFor the multiple-table syntax, UPDATE updates rows in each table named\nin table_references that satisfy the conditions. Each matching row is\nupdated once, even if it matches the conditions multiple times. For\nmultiple-table syntax, ORDER BY and LIMIT cannot be used.\n\nFor partitioned tables, both the single-single and multiple-table forms\nof this statement support the use of a PARTITION clause as part of a\ntable reference. This option takes a list of one or more partitions or\nsubpartitions (or both). Only the partitions (or subpartitions) listed\nare checked for matches, and a row that is not in any of these\npartitions or subpartitions is not updated, whether it satisfies the\nwhere_condition or not.\n\n*Note*:\n\nUnlike the case when using PARTITION with an INSERT or REPLACE\nstatement, an otherwise valid UPDATE ... PARTITION statement is\nconsidered successful even if no rows in the listed partitions (or\nsubpartitions) match the where_condition.\n\nFor more information and examples, see\nhttps://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.4/en/partitioning-selection.html.\n\nwhere_condition is an expression that evaluates to true for each row to\nbe updated.

You need only the SELECT privilege for any\ncolumns that are read but not modified.\n\nThe UPDATE statement supports the following modifiers:\n\no With the LOW_PRIORITY modifier, execution of the UPDATE is delayed\n  until no other clients are reading from the table. This affects only\n  storage engines that use only table-level locking (such as MyISAM,\n  MEMORY, and MERGE).\n\no With the IGNORE modifier, the update statement does not abort even if\n  errors occur during the update.
