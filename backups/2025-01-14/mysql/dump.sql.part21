To keep\n  the index maintenance period to a reasonable time, set the\n  innodb_ft_num_word_optimize option to specify how many words to\n  update in the search index, and run a sequence of OPTIMIZE TABLE\n  statements until the search index is fully updated.\n\no After deleting a large part of a MyISAM or ARCHIVE table, or making\n  many changes to a MyISAM or ARCHIVE table with variable-length rows\n  (tables that have VARCHAR, VARBINARY, BLOB, or TEXT columns). Deleted\n  rows are maintained in a linked list and subsequent INSERT operations\n  reuse old row positions. You can use OPTIMIZE TABLE to reclaim the\n  unused space and to defragment the data file. After extensive changes\n  to a table, this statement may also improve performance of statements\n  that use the table, sometimes significantly.\n\nThis statement requires SELECT and INSERT privileges for the table.\n\nOPTIMIZE TABLE works for InnoDB, MyISAM, and ARCHIVE tables. OPTIMIZE\nTABLE is also supported for dynamic columns of in-memory NDB tables. It\ndoes not work for fixed-width columns of in-memory tables, nor does it\nwork for Disk Data tables. The performance of OPTIMIZE on NDB Cluster\ntables can be tuned using --ndb-optimization-delay, which controls the\nlength of time to wait between processing batches of rows by OPTIMIZE\nTABLE. For more information, see\nhttps://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.4/en/mysql-cluster-limitations-resol\nved.html.\n\nFor NDB Cluster tables, OPTIMIZE TABLE can be interrupted by (for\nexample) killing the SQL thread performing the OPTIMIZE operation.\n\nBy default, OPTIMIZE TABLE does not work for tables created using any\nother storage engine and returns a result indicating this lack of\nsupport. You can make OPTIMIZE TABLE work for other storage engines by\nstarting mysqld with the --skip-new option. In this case, OPTIMIZE\nTABLE is just mapped to ALTER TABLE.\n\nThis statement does not work with views.\n\nOPTIMIZE TABLE is supported for partitioned tables. For information\nabout using this statement with partitioned tables and table\npartitions, see\nhttps://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.4/en/partitioning-maintenance.html.\n\nBy default, the server writes OPTIMIZE TABLE statements to the binary\nlog so that they replicate to replicas.

A component provides services that are available to the\nserver and other components; see\nhttps://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.4/en/components.html. INSTALL\nCOMPONENT requires the INSERT privilege for the mysql.component system\ntable because it adds a row to that table to register the component.\n\nExample:\n\nINSTALL COMPONENT \'file://component1\', \'file://component2\';\n\nA component is named using a URN that begins with file:// and indicates\nthe base name of the library file that implements the component,\nlocated in the directory named by the plugin_dir system variable.\nComponent names do not include any platform-dependent file name suffix\nsuch as .so or .dll. (These naming details are subject to change\nbecause component name interpretation is itself performed by a service\nand the component infrastructure makes it possible to replace the\ndefault service implementation with alternative implementations.)\n\nINSTALL COMPONENT permits setting the values of component system\nvariables when you install one or more components. The SET clause\nenables you to specify variable values precisely when they are needed,\nwithout the inconvenience or limitations associated with other forms of\nassignment. Specifically, you can also set component variables with\nthese alternatives:\n\no At server startup using options on the command line or in an option\n  file, but doing so involves a server restart. The values do not take\n  effect until you install the component. You can specify an invalid\n  variable name for a component on the command line without triggering\n  an error.\n\no Dynamically while the server is running by means of the SET\n  statement, which enables you to modify operation of the server\n  without having to stop and restart it. Setting a read-only variable\n  is not permitted.\n\nThe optional SET clause applies a value, or values, only to the\ncomponent specified in the INSTALL COMPONENT statement, rather than to\nall subsequent installations of that component. SET GLOBAL|PERSIST\nworks for all types of variables, including read-only variables,\nwithout having to restart the server. A component system variable that\nyou set using INSTALL COMPONENT takes precedence over any conflicting\nvalue coming from the command line or an option file.\n\nExample:\n\nINSTALL COMPONENT \'file://component1\', \'file://component2\' \n    SET GLOBAL component1.var1 = 12 + 3, PERSIST component2.var2 = \'strings\';\n\nOmitting PERSIST or GLOBAL is equivalent to specifying GLOBAL.\n\nSpecifying PERSIST for any variable in SET silently executes SET\nPERSIST_ONLY immediately after INSTALL COMPONENT loads the components,\nbut before updating the mysql.component table. If SET PERSIST_ONLY\nfails, then the server unloads all of the previously loaded new\ncomponents without persisting anything to mysql.component.\n\nThe SET clause accepts only valid variable names of the component being\ninstalled and emits an error message for all invalid names. Subqueries,\nstored functions, and aggregate functions are not permitted as part of\nthe value expression. If you install a single component, it is not\nnecessary to prefix the variable name with the component name.\n\n*Note*:\n\nWhile specifying a variable value using the SET clause is similar to\nthat of the command line---it is available immediately at variable\nregistration---there is a distinct difference in how the SET clause\nhandles invalid numerical values for boolean variables. For example, if\nyou set a boolean variable to 11 (component1.boolvar = 11), you see the\nfollowing behavior:\n\no SET clause yields true\n\no Command line yields false (11 is neither ON nor 1)\n\nIf any error occurs, the statement fails and has no effect. For\nexample, this happens if a component name is erroneous, a named\ncomponent does not exist or is already installed, or component\ninitialization fails.\n\nA loader service handles component loading, which includes adding\ninstalled components to the mysql.component system table that serves as\na registry. For subsequent server restarts, any components listed in\nmysql.component are loaded by the loader service during the startup\nsequence. This occurs even if the server is started with the\n--skip-grant-tables option.\n\nIf a component depends on services not present in the registry and you\nattempt to install the component without also installing the component\nor components that provide the services on which it depends, an error\noccurs:\n\nERROR 3527 (HY000): Cannot satisfy dependency for service \'component_a\'\nrequired by component \'component_b\'.\n\nTo avoid this problem, either install all components in the same\nstatement, or install the dependent component after installing any\ncomponents on which it depends.\n\n*Note*:\n\nFor keyring components, do not use INSTALL COMPONENT. Instead,\nconfigure keyring component loading using a manifest file.

Plugin names are not case-sensitive. For maximal\ncompatibility, plugin names should be limited to ASCII letters, digits,\nand underscore because they are used in C source files, shell command\nlines, M4 and Bourne shell scripts, and SQL environments.\n\nshared_library_name is the name of the shared library that contains the\nplugin code. The name includes the file name extension (for example,\nlibmyplugin.so, libmyplugin.dll, or libmyplugin.dylib).\n\nThe shared library must be located in the plugin directory (the\ndirectory named by the plugin_dir system variable). The library must be\nin the plugin directory itself, not in a subdirectory. By default,\nplugin_dir is the plugin directory under the directory named by the\npkglibdir configuration variable, but it can be changed by setting the\nvalue of plugin_dir at server startup. For example, set its value in a\nmy.cnf file:\n\n[mysqld]\nplugin_dir=/path/to/plugin/directory\n\nIf the value of plugin_dir is a relative path name, it is taken to be\nrelative to the MySQL base directory (the value of the basedir system\nvariable).\n\nINSTALL PLUGIN loads and initializes the plugin code to make the plugin\navailable for use. A plugin is initialized by executing its\ninitialization function, which handles any setup that the plugin must\nperform before it can be used. When the server shuts down, it executes\nthe deinitialization function for each plugin that is loaded so that\nthe plugin has a chance to perform any final cleanup.\n\nINSTALL PLUGIN also registers the plugin by adding a line that\nindicates the plugin name and library file name to the mysql.plugin\nsystem table.
