While it is\n  permitted to shut down and restart the server while redo logging is\n  disabled, an unexpected server stoppage while redo logging is\n  disabled can cause data loss and instance corruption.\n\n  An ALTER INSTANCE [ENABLE|DISABLE] INNODB REDO_LOG operation requires\n  an exclusive backup lock, which prevents other ALTER INSTANCE\n  operations from executing concurrently.

Key rotation requires the ENCRYPTION_KEY_ADMIN\n  or SUPER privilege. To perform this action, a keyring plugin must be\n  installed and configured. For instructions, see\n  https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.4/en/keyring.html.\n\n  ALTER INSTANCE ROTATE INNODB MASTER KEY supports concurrent DML.\n  However, it cannot be run concurrently with CREATE TABLE ...\n  ENCRYPTION or ALTER TABLE ... ENCRYPTION operations, and locks are\n  taken to prevent conflicts that could arise from concurrent execution\n  of these statements. If one of the conflicting statements is running,\n  it must complete before another can proceed.\n\n  ALTER INSTANCE ROTATE INNODB MASTER KEY statements are written to the\n  binary log so that they can be executed on replicated servers.\n\n  For additional ALTER INSTANCE ROTATE INNODB MASTER KEY usage\n  information, see\n  https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.4/en/innodb-data-encryption.html.\n\no ALTER INSTANCE ROTATE BINLOG MASTER KEY\n\n  This action rotates the binary log master key used for binary log\n  encryption. Key rotation for the binary log master key requires the\n  BINLOG_ENCRYPTION_ADMIN or SUPER privilege. The statement cannot be\n  used if the binlog_encryption system variable is set to OFF. To\n  perform this action, a keyring plugin must be installed and\n  configured. For instructions, see\n  https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.4/en/keyring.html.\n\n  ALTER INSTANCE ROTATE BINLOG MASTER KEY actions are not written to\n  the binary log and are not executed on replicas. Binary log master\n  key rotation can therefore be carried out in replication environments\n  including a mix of MySQL versions. To schedule regular rotation of\n  the binary log master key on all applicable source and replica\n  servers, you can enable the MySQL Event Scheduler on each server and\n  issue the ALTER INSTANCE ROTATE BINLOG MASTER KEY statement using a\n  CREATE EVENT statement. If you rotate the binary log master key\n  because you suspect that the current or any of the previous binary\n  log master keys might have been compromised, issue the statement on\n  every applicable source and replica server, which enables you to\n  verify immediate compliance.\n\n  For additional ALTER INSTANCE ROTATE BINLOG MASTER KEY usage\n  information, including what to do if the process does not complete\n  correctly or is interrupted by an unexpected server halt, see\n  https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.4/en/replication-binlog-encryption\n  .html.\n\no ALTER INSTANCE RELOAD TLS\n\n  This action reconfigures a TLS context from the current values of the\n  system variables that define the context. It also updates the status\n  variables that reflect the active context values. This action\n  requires the CONNECTION_ADMIN privilege. For additional information\n  about reconfiguring the TLS context, including which system and\n  status variables are context-related, see\n  https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.4/en/using-encrypted-connections.h\n  tml#using-encrypted-connections-server-side-runtime-configuration.\n\n  By default, the statement reloads the TLS context for the main\n  connection interface. If the FOR CHANNEL clause is given, the\n  statement reloads the TLS context for the named channel: mysql_main\n  for the main connection interface, mysql_admin for the administrative\n  connection interface. For information about the different interfaces,\n  see\n  https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.4/en/connection-interfaces.html.\n  The updated TLS context properties are exposed in the Performance\n  Schema tls_channel_status table. See\n  https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.4/en/performance-schema-tls-channe\n  l-status-table.html.\n\n  Updating the TLS context for the main interface may also affect the\n  administrative interface because unless some nondefault TLS value is\n  configured for that interface, it uses the same TLS context as the\n  main interface.\n\n  *Note*:\n\n  When you reload the TLS context, OpenSSL reloads the file containing\n  the CRL (certificate revocation list) as part of the process. If the\n  CRL file is large, the server allocates a large chunk of memory (ten\n  times the file size), which is doubled while the new instance is\n  being loaded and the old one has not yet been released. The process\n  resident memory is not immediately reduced after a large allocation\n  is freed, so if you issue the ALTER INSTANCE RELOAD TLS statement\n  repeatedly with a large CRL file, the process resident memory usage\n  may grow as a result of this.\n\n  By default, the RELOAD TLS action rolls back with an error and has no\n  effect if the configuration values do not permit creation of the new\n  TLS context. The previous context values continue to be used for new\n  connections. If the optional NO ROLLBACK ON ERROR clause is given and\n  the new context cannot be created, rollback does not occur. Instead,\n  a warning is generated and encryption is disabled for new connections\n  on the interface to which the statement applies.\n\n  ALTER INSTANCE RELOAD TLS statements are not written to the binary\n  log (and thus are not replicated). TLS configuration is local and\n  depends on local files not necessarily present on all servers\n  involved.\n\no ALTER INSTANCE RELOAD KEYRING\n\n  If a keyring component is installed, this action tells the component\n  to re-read its configuration file and reinitialize any keyring\n  in-memory data. If you modify the component configuration at runtime,\n  the new configuration does not take effect until you perform this\n  action. Keyring reloading requires the ENCRYPTION_KEY_ADMIN\n  privilege.\n\n  This action enables reconfiguring only the currently installed\n  keyring component. It does not enable changing which component is\n  installed. For example, if you change the configuration for the\n  installed keyring component, ALTER INSTANCE RELOAD KEYRING causes the\n  new configuration to take effect. On the other hand, if you change\n  the keyring component named in the server manifest file, ALTER\n  INSTANCE RELOAD KEYRING has no effect and the current component\n  remains installed.\n\n  ALTER INSTANCE RELOAD KEYRING statements are not written to the\n  binary log (and thus are not replicated).\n\nURL: https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.4/en/alter-instance.html\n\n','','https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.4/en/alter-instance.html'),(506,'ALTER LOGFILE GROUP',40,'Syntax:\nALTER LOGFILE GROUP logfile_group\n    ADD UNDOFILE \'file_name\'\n    [INITIAL_SIZE [=] size]\n    [WAIT]\n    ENGINE [=] engine_name\n\nThis statement adds an UNDO file named \'file_name\' to an existing log\nfile group logfile_group.

If the DEFINER clause is present, the\nprivileges required depend on the user value, as discussed in\nhttps://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.4/en/stored-objects-security.html.\n\nThe minimum requirements for a valid CREATE EVENT statement are as\nfollows:\n\no The keywords CREATE EVENT plus an event name, which uniquely\n  identifies the event in a database schema.\n\no An ON SCHEDULE clause, which determines when and how often the event\n  executes.\n\no A DO clause, which contains the SQL statement to be executed by an\n  event.\n\nThis is an example of a minimal CREATE EVENT statement:\n\nCREATE EVENT myevent\n    ON SCHEDULE AT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP + INTERVAL 1 HOUR\n    DO\n      UPDATE myschema.mytable SET mycol = mycol + 1;\n\nThe previous statement creates an event named myevent. This event\nexecutes once---one hour following its creation---by running an SQL\nstatement that increments the value of the myschema.mytable table\'s\nmycol column by 1.\n\nThe event_name must be a valid MySQL identifier with a maximum length\nof 64 characters. Event names are not case-sensitive, so you cannot\nhave two events named myevent and MyEvent in the same schema. In\ngeneral, the rules governing event names are the same as those for\nnames of stored routines. See\nhttps://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.4/en/identifiers.html.\n\nAn event is associated with a schema. If no schema is indicated as part\nof event_name, the default (current) schema is assumed.

For rules covering the naming\nof log file groups, see\nhttps://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.4/en/identifiers.html.\n\n*Note*:\n\nAll NDB Cluster Disk Data objects share the same namespace. This means\nthat each Disk Data object must be uniquely named (and not merely each\nDisk Data object of a given type). For example, you cannot have a\ntablespace and a log file group with the same name, or a tablespace and\na data file with the same name.\n\nThere can be only one log file group per NDB Cluster instance at any\ngiven time.\n\nThe optional INITIAL_SIZE parameter sets the undo file\'s initial size;\nif not specified, it defaults to 128M (128 megabytes). The optional\nUNDO_BUFFER_SIZE parameter sets the size used by the undo buffer for\nthe log file group; The default value for UNDO_BUFFER_SIZE is 8M (eight\nmegabytes); this value cannot exceed the amount of system memory\navailable. Both of these parameters are specified in bytes. You may\noptionally follow either or both of these with a one-letter\nabbreviation for an order of magnitude, similar to those used in\nmy.cnf. Generally, this is one of the letters M (for megabytes) or G\n(for gigabytes).\n\nMemory used for UNDO_BUFFER_SIZE comes from the global pool whose size\nis determined by the value of the SharedGlobalMemory data node\nconfiguration parameter. This includes any default value implied for\nthis option by the setting of the InitialLogFileGroup data node\nconfiguration parameter.\n\nThe maximum permitted for UNDO_BUFFER_SIZE is 629145600 (600 MB).\n\nOn 32-bit systems, the maximum supported value for INITIAL_SIZE is\n4294967296 (4 GB). (Bug #29186)\n\nThe minimum allowed value for INITIAL_SIZE is 1048576 (1 MB).\n\nThe ENGINE option determines the storage engine to be used by this log\nfile group, with engine_name being the name of the storage engine. This\nmust be NDB (or NDBCLUSTER). If ENGINE is not set, MySQL tries to use\nthe engine specified by the default_storage_engine server system\nvariable. In any case, if the engine is not specified as NDB or\nNDBCLUSTER, the CREATE LOGFILE GROUP statement appears to succeed but\nactually fails to create the log file group, as shown here:\n\nmysql> CREATE LOGFILE GROUP lg1\n    ->     ADD UNDOFILE \'undo.dat\' INITIAL_SIZE = 10M;\nQuery OK, 0 rows affected, 1 warning (0.00 sec)\n\nmysql> SHOW WARNINGS;\n+-------+------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n| Level | Code | Message                                                                                        |\n+-------+------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n| Error | 1478 | Table storage engine \'InnoDB\' does not support the create option \'TABLESPACE or LOGFILE GROUP\' |\n+-------+------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+\n1 row in set (0.00 sec)\n\nmysql> DROP LOGFILE GROUP lg1 ENGINE = NDB;\nERROR 1529 (HY000): Failed to drop LOGFILE GROUP\n\nmysql> CREATE LOGFILE GROUP lg1\n    ->     ADD UNDOFILE \'undo.dat\' INITIAL_SIZE = 10M\n    ->     ENGINE = NDB;\nQuery OK, 0 rows affected (2.97 sec)\n\nThe fact that the CREATE LOGFILE GROUP statement does not actually\nreturn an error when a storage engine other than NDB is specified, but\nrather appears to succeed, is a known issue which we hope to address in\na future version of NDB Cluster.\n\nREDO_BUFFER_SIZE, NODEGROUP, WAIT, and COMMENT are parsed but ignored,\nand so have no effect in MySQL 8.4. These options are intended for\nfuture expansion.\n\nWhen used with ENGINE [=] NDB, a log file group and associated undo log\nfile are created on each Cluster data node. You can verify that the\nundo files were created and obtain information about them by querying\nthe Information Schema FILES table. For example:\n\nmysql> SELECT LOGFILE_GROUP_NAME, LOGFILE_GROUP_NUMBER, EXTRA\n    -> FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.FILES\n    -> WHERE FILE_NAME = \'undo_10.dat\';\n+--------------------+----------------------+----------------+\n| LOGFILE_GROUP_NAME | LOGFILE_GROUP_NUMBER | EXTRA          |\n+--------------------+----------------------+----------------+\n| lg_3               |                   11 | CLUSTER_NODE=3 |\n| lg_3               |                   11 | CLUSTER_NODE=4 |\n+--------------------+----------------------+----------------+\n2 rows in set (0.06 sec)\n\nCREATE LOGFILE GROUP is useful only with Disk Data storage for NDB\nCluster.

That is, the specified routine becomes known to\nthe server. By default, a stored routine is associated with the default\ndatabase. To associate the routine explicitly with a given database,\nspecify the name as db_name.sp_name when you create it.\n\nThe CREATE FUNCTION statement is also used in MySQL to support loadable\nfunctions. See [HELP CREATE FUNCTION loadable function]. A loadable\nfunction can be regarded as an external stored function. Stored\nfunctions share their namespace with loadable functions. See\nhttps://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.4/en/function-resolution.html, for\nthe rules describing how the server interprets references to different\nkinds of functions.\n\nTo invoke a stored procedure, use the CALL statement (see [HELP CALL]).\nTo invoke a stored function, refer to it in an expression. The function\nreturns a value during expression evaluation.\n\nCREATE PROCEDURE and CREATE FUNCTION require the CREATE ROUTINE\nprivilege. If the DEFINER clause is present, the privileges required\ndepend on the user value, as discussed in\nhttps://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.4/en/stored-objects-security.html.\nIf binary logging is enabled, CREATE FUNCTION might require the SUPER\nprivilege, as discussed in\nhttps://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.4/en/stored-programs-logging.html.\n\nBy default, MySQL automatically grants the ALTER ROUTINE and EXECUTE\nprivileges to the routine creator. This behavior can be changed by\ndisabling the automatic_sp_privileges system variable. See\nhttps://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.4/en/stored-routines-privileges.html\n.\n\nThe DEFINER and SQL SECURITY clauses specify the security context to be\nused when checking access privileges at routine execution time, as\ndescribed later in this section.\n\nIf the routine name is the same as the name of a built-in SQL function,\na syntax error occurs unless you use a space between the name and the\nfollowing parenthesis when defining the routine or invoking it later.\nFor this reason, avoid using the names of existing SQL functions for\nyour own stored routines.\n\nThe IGNORE_SPACE SQL mode applies to built-in functions, not to stored\nroutines. It is always permissible to have spaces after a stored\nroutine name, regardless of whether IGNORE_SPACE is enabled.\n\nIF NOT EXISTS prevents an error from occurring if there already exists\na routine with the same name. This option is supported with both CREATE\nFUNCTION and CREATE PROCEDURE.\n\nIf a built-in function with the same name already exists, attempting to\ncreate a stored function with CREATE FUNCTION ... IF NOT EXISTS\nsucceeds with a warning indicating that it has the same name as a\nnative function; this is no different than when performing the same\nCREATE FUNCTION statement without specifying IF NOT EXISTS.\n\nIf a loadable function with the same name already exists, attempting to\ncreate a stored function using IF NOT EXISTS succeeds with a warning.\nThis is the same as without specifying IF NOT EXISTS.\n\nSee\nhttps://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.4/en/function-resolution.html#functi\non-name-resolution, for more information.\n\nThe parameter list enclosed within parentheses must always be present.\nIf there are no parameters, an empty parameter list of () should be\nused. Parameter names are not case-sensitive.\n\nEach parameter is an IN parameter by default. To specify otherwise for\na parameter, use the keyword OUT or INOUT before the parameter name.\n\n*Note*:\n\nSpecifying a parameter as IN, OUT, or INOUT is valid only for a\nPROCEDURE. For a FUNCTION, parameters are always regarded as IN\nparameters.\n\nAn IN parameter passes a value into a procedure. The procedure might\nmodify the value, but the modification is not visible to the caller\nwhen the procedure returns. An OUT parameter passes a value from the\nprocedure back to the caller. Its initial value is NULL within the\nprocedure, and its value is visible to the caller when the procedure\nreturns. An INOUT parameter is initialized by the caller, can be\nmodified by the procedure, and any change made by the procedure is\nvisible to the caller when the procedure returns.\n\nFor each OUT or INOUT parameter, pass a user-defined variable in the\nCALL statement that invokes the procedure so that you can obtain its\nvalue when the procedure returns. If you are calling the procedure from\nwithin another stored procedure or function, you can also pass a\nroutine parameter or local routine variable as an OUT or INOUT\nparameter. If you are calling the procedure from within a trigger, you\ncan also pass NEW.col_name as an OUT or INOUT parameter.\n\nFor information about the effect of unhandled conditions on procedure\nparameters, see\nhttps://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.4/en/conditions-and-parameters.html.\n\nRoutine parameters cannot be referenced in statements prepared within\nthe routine; see\nhttps://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.4/en/stored-program-restrictions.html\n.\n\nThe following example shows a simple stored procedure that, given a\ncountry code, counts the number of cities for that country that appear\nin the city table of the world database. The country code is passed\nusing an IN parameter, and the city count is returned using an OUT\nparameter:\n\nmysql> delimiter //\n\nmysql> CREATE PROCEDURE citycount (IN country CHAR(3), OUT cities INT)\n       BEGIN\n         SELECT COUNT(*) INTO cities FROM world.city\n         WHERE CountryCode = country;\n       END//\nQuery OK, 0 rows affected (0.01 sec)\n\nmysql> delimiter ;\n\nmysql> CALL citycount(\'JPN\', @cities); -- cities in Japan\nQuery OK, 1 row affected (0.00 sec)\n\nmysql> SELECT @cities;\n+---------+\n| @cities |\n+---------+\n|     248 |\n+---------+\n1 row in set (0.00 sec)\n\nmysql> CALL citycount(\'FRA\', @cities); -- cities in France\nQuery OK, 1 row affected (0.00 sec)\n\nmysql> SELECT @cities;\n+---------+\n| @cities |\n+---------+\n|      40 |\n+---------+\n1 row in set (0.00 sec)\n\nThe example uses the mysql client delimiter command to change the\nstatement delimiter from ; to // while the procedure is being defined.\nThis enables the ; delimiter used in the procedure body to be passed\nthrough to the server rather than being interpreted by mysql itself.\nSee\nhttps://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.4/en/stored-programs-defining.html.\n\nThe RETURNS clause may be specified only for a FUNCTION, for which it\nis mandatory. It indicates the return type of the function, and the\nfunction body must contain a RETURN value statement. If the RETURN\nstatement returns a value of a different type, the value is coerced to\nthe proper type. For example, if a function specifies an ENUM or SET\nvalue in the RETURNS clause, but the RETURN statement returns an\ninteger, the value returned from the function is the string for the\ncorresponding ENUM member of set of SET members.\n\nThe following example function takes a parameter, performs an operation\nusing an SQL function, and returns the result. In this case, it is\nunnecessary to use delimiter because the function definition contains\nno internal ; statement delimiters:\n\nmysql> CREATE FUNCTION hello (s CHAR(20))\nmysql> RETURNS CHAR(50) DETERMINISTIC\n       RETURN CONCAT(\'Hello, \',s,\'!\');\nQuery OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)\n\nmysql> SELECT hello(\'world\');\n+----------------+\n| hello(\'world\') |\n+----------------+\n| Hello, world!  |\n+----------------+\n1 row in set (0.00 sec)\n\nParameter types and function return types can be declared to use any\nvalid data type. The COLLATE attribute can be used if preceded by a\nCHARACTER SET specification.\n\nThe routine_body consists of a valid SQL routine statement. This can be\na simple statement such as SELECT or INSERT, or a compound statement\nwritten using BEGIN and END. Compound statements can contain\ndeclarations, loops, and other control structure statements. The syntax\nfor these statements is described in\nhttps://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.4/en/sql-compound-statements.html.\nIn practice, stored functions tend to use compound statements, unless\nthe body consists of a single RETURN statement.\n\nMySQL permits routines to contain DDL statements, such as CREATE and\nDROP. MySQL also permits stored procedures (but not stored functions)\nto contain SQL transaction statements such as COMMIT. Stored functions\nmay not contain statements that perform explicit or implicit commit or\nrollback. Support for these statements is not required by the SQL\nstandard, which states that each DBMS vendor may decide whether to\npermit them.\n\nStatements that return a result set can be used within a stored\nprocedure but not within a stored function. This prohibition includes\nSELECT statements that do not have an INTO var_list clause and other\nstatements such as SHOW, EXPLAIN, and CHECK TABLE. For statements that\ncan be determined at function definition time to return a result set, a\nNot allowed to return a result set from a function error occurs\n(ER_SP_NO_RETSET\n(https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-errors/8.4/en/server-error-reference.html\n#error_er_sp_no_retset)). For statements that can be determined only\nat runtime to return a result set, a PROCEDURE %s can\'t return a result\nset in the given context error occurs (ER_SP_BADSELECT\n(https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-errors/8.4/en/server-error-reference.html\n#error_er_sp_badselect)).\n\nUSE statements within stored routines are not permitted. When a routine\nis invoked, an implicit USE db_name is performed (and undone when the\nroutine terminates). The causes the routine to have the given default\ndatabase while it executes. References to objects in databases other\nthan the routine default database should be qualified with the\nappropriate database name.\n\nFor additional information about statements that are not permitted in\nstored routines, see\nhttps://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.4/en/stored-program-restrictions.html\n.\n\nFor information about invoking stored procedures from within programs\nwritten in a language that has a MySQL interface, see [HELP CALL].\n\nMySQL stores the sql_mode system variable setting in effect when a\nroutine is created or altered, and always executes the routine with\nthis setting in force, regardless of the current server SQL mode when\nthe routine begins executing.\n\nThe switch from the SQL mode of the invoker to that of the routine\noccurs after evaluation of arguments and assignment of the resulting\nvalues to routine parameters. If you define a routine in strict SQL\nmode but invoke it in nonstrict mode, assignment of arguments to\nroutine parameters does not take place in strict mode. If you require\nthat expressions passed to a routine be assigned in strict SQL mode,\nyou should invoke the routine with strict mode in effect.\n\nURL: https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.4/en/create-procedure.html\n\n','','https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.4/en/create-procedure.html'),(518,'CREATE FUNCTION',40,'Syntax:\nCREATE\n    [DEFINER = user]\n    PROCEDURE [IF NOT EXISTS] sp_name ([proc_parameter[,...]])\n    [characteristic ...] routine_body\n\nCREATE\n    [DEFINER = user]\n    FUNCTION [IF NOT EXISTS] sp_name ([func_parameter[,...]])\n    RETURNS type\n    [characteristic ...] routine_body\n\nproc_parameter:\n    [ IN | OUT | INOUT ] param_name type\n\nfunc_parameter:\n    param_name type\n\ntype:\n    Any valid MySQL data type\n\ncharacteristic: {\n    COMMENT \'string\'\n  | LANGUAGE SQL  | [NOT] DETERMINISTIC\n  | { CONTAINS SQL | NO SQL | READS SQL DATA | MODIFIES SQL DATA }\n  | SQL SECURITY { DEFINER | INVOKER }\n}\n\nroutine_body:\n    SQL routine\n\nThese statements are used to create a stored routine (a stored\nprocedure or function).
