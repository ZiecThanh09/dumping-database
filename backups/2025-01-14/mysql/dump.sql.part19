sage and stops waiting,\nbut the STOP REPLICA instruction remains in effect. Once the\nreplication threads are no longer busy, the STOP REPLICA statement is\nexecuted and the replica stops.\n\nSome CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO statements are allowed while the\nreplica is running, depending on the states of the replication threads.\nHowever, using STOP REPLICA prior to executing a CHANGE REPLICATION\nSOURCE TO statement in such cases is still supported. See [HELP CHANGE\nREPLICATION SOURCE TO], and\nhttps://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.4/en/replication-solutions-switch.html\n, for more information.\n\nThe optional FOR CHANNEL channel clause enables you to name which\nreplication channel the statement applies to. Providing a FOR CHANNEL\nchannel clause applies the STOP REPLICA statement to a specific\nreplication channel. If no channel is named and no extra channels\nexist, the statement applies to the default channel. If a STOP REPLICA\nstatement does not name a channel when using multiple channels, this\nstatement stops the specified threads for all channels. See\nhttps://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.4/en/replication-channels.html for\nmore information.\n\nThe replication channels for Group Replication\n(group_replication_applier and group_replication_recovery) are managed\nautomatically by the server instance. STOP REPLICA cannot be used at\nall with the group_replication_recovery channel, and should only be\nused with the group_replication_applier channel when Group Replication\nis not running. The group_replication_applier channel only has an\napplier thread and has no receiver thread, so it can be stopped if\nrequired by using the SQL_THREAD option without the IO_THREAD option.\n\nWhen the replica is multithreaded (replica_parallel_workers is a\nnonzero value), any gaps in the sequence of transactions executed from\nthe relay log are closed as part of stopping the worker threads. If the\nreplica is stopped unexpectedly (for example due to an error in a\nworker thread, or another thread issuing KILL) while a STOP REPLICA\nstatement is executing, the sequence of executed transactions from the\nrelay log may become inconsistent. See\nhttps://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.4/en/replication-features-transactio\nn-inconsistencies.html, for more information.\n\nWhen the source is using the row-based binary logging format, you\nshould execute STOP REPLICA or STOP REPLICA SQL_THREAD on the replica\nprior to shutting down the replica server if you are replicating any\ntables that use a nontransactional storage engine. If the current\nreplication event group has modified one or more nontransactional\ntables, STOP REPLICA waits for up to 60 seconds for the event group to\ncomplete, unless you issue a KILL QUERY or KILL CONNECTION statement\nfor the replication SQL thread. If the event group remains incomplete\nafter the timeout, an error message is logged.\n\nWhen the source is using the statement-based binary logging format,\nchanging the source while it has open temporary tables is potentially\nunsafe. This is one of the reasons why statement-based replication of\ntemporary tables is not recommended. You can find out whether there are\nany temporary tables on the replica by checking the value of\nReplica_open_temp_tables. When using statement-based replication, this\nvalue should be 0 before executing CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO. If\nthere are any temporary tables open on the replica, issuing a CHANGE\nREPLICATION SOURCE TO statement after issuing a STOP REPLICA causes an\nER_WARN_OPEN_TEMP_TABLES_MUST_BE_ZERO\n(https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-errors/8.4/en/server-error-reference.html\n#error_er_warn_open_temp_tables_must_be_zero) warning.\n\nURL: https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.4/en/stop-replica.html\n\n','','https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.4/en/stop-replica.html'),(580,'PREPARE',44,'Syntax:\nPREPARE stmt_name FROM preparable_stmt\n\nThe PREPARE statement prepares a SQL statement and assigns it a name,\nstmt_name, by which to refer to the statement later. The prepared\nstatement is executed with EXECUTE and released with DEALLOCATE\nPREPARE. For examples, see\nhttps://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.4/en/sql-prepared-statements.html.\n\nStatement names are not case-sensitive. preparable_stmt is either a\nstring literal or a user variable that contains the text of the SQL\nstatement. The text must represent a single statement, not multiple\nstatements. Within the statement, ? characters can be used as parameter\nmarkers to indicate where data values are to be bound to the query\nlater when you execute it. The ? characters should not be enclosed\nwithin quotation marks, even if you intend to bind them to string\nvalues. Parameter markers can be used only where data values should\nappear, not for SQL keywords, identifiers, and so forth.\n\nIf a prepared statement with the given name already exists, it is\ndeallocated implicitly before the new statement is prepared. This means\nthat if the new statement contains an error and cannot be prepared, an\nerror is returned and no statement with the given name exists.\n\nThe scope of a prepared statement is the session within which it is\ncreated, which as several implications:\n\no A prepared statement created in one session is not available to other\n  sessions.\n\no When a session ends, whether normally or abnormally, its prepared\n  statements no longer exist. If auto-reconnect is enabled, the client\n  is not notified that the connection was lost. For this reason,\n  clients may wish to disable auto-reconnect. See Automatic\n  Reconnection Control\n  (https://dev.mysql.com/doc/c-api/8.4/en/c-api-auto-reconnect.html).\n\no A prepared statement created within a stored program continues to\n  exist after the program finishes executing and can be executed\n  outside the program later.\n\no A statement prepared in stored program context cannot refer to stored\n  procedure or function parameters or local variables because they go\n  out of scope when the program ends and would be unavailable were the\n  statement to be executed later outside the program. As a workaround,\n  refer instead to user-defined variables, which also have session\n  scope; see\n  https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.4/en/user-variables.html.\n\nThe type of a parameter used in a prepared statement is determined when\nthe statement is first prepared; it retains this type whenever EXECUTE\nis invoked for this prepared statement (unless the statement is\nreprepared, as explained later in this section). Rules for determining\na parameter\'s type are listed here:\n\no A parameter which is an operand of a binary arithmetic operator has\n  the same data type as the other operand.\n\no If both operands of a binary arithmetic operator are parameters, the\n  type of the parameters is decided by the context of the operator.\n\no If a parameter is the operand of a unary arithmetic operator, the\n  parameter\'s type is decided by the context of the operator.\n\no If an arithmetic operator has no type-determining context, the\n  derived type for any parameters involved is DOUBLE PRECISION. This\n  can happen, for example, when the parameter is a top-level node in a\n  SELECT list, or when it is part of a comparison operator.\n\no A parameter which is an operand of a character string operator has\n  the same derived type as the aggregated type of the other operands.\n  If all operands of the operator are parameters, the derived type is\n  VARCHAR; its collation is determined by the value of\n  collation_connection.\n\no A parameter which is an operand of a temporal operator has type\n  DATETIME if the operator returns a DATETIME, TIME if the operator\n  returns a TIME, and DATE if the operator returns a DATE.\n\no A parameter which is an operand of a binary comparison operator has\n  the same derived type as the other operand of the comparison.\n\no A parameter that is an operand of a ternary comparison operator such\n  as BETWEEN has the same derived type as the aggregated type of the\n  other operands.\n\no If all operands of a comparison operator are parameters, the derived\n  type for each of them is VARCHAR, with collation determined by the\n  value of collation_connection.\n\no A parameter that is an output operand of any of CASE, COALESCE, IF,\n  IFNULL, or NULLIF has the same derived type as the aggregated type of\n  the operator\'s other output operands.\n\no If all output operands of any of CASE, COALESCE, IF, IFNULL, or\n  NULLIF are parameters, or they are all NULL, the type of the\n  parameter is decided by the context of the operator.\n\no If the parameter is an operand of any of CASE, COALESCE(), IF, or\n  IFNULL, and has no type-determining context, the derived type for\n  each of the parameters involved is VARCHAR, and its collation is\n  determined by the value of collation_connection.\n\no A parameter which is the operand of a CAST() has the same type as\n  specified by the CAST().\n\no If a parameter is an immediate member of a SELECT list that is not\n  part of an INSERT statement, the derived type of the parameter is\n  VARCHAR, and its collation is determined by the value of\n  collation_connection.\n\no If a parameter is an immediate member of a SELECT list that is part\n  of an INSERT statement, the derived type of the parameter is the type\n  of the corresponding column into which the parameter is inserted.\n\no If a parameter is used as source for an assignment in a SET clause of\n  an UPDATE statement or in the ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE clause of an\n  INSERT statement, the derived type of the parameter is the type of\n  the corresponding column which is updated by the SET or ON DUPLICATE\n  KEY UPDATE clause.\n\no If a parameter is an argument of a function, the derived type depends\n  on the function\'s return type.\n\nFor some combinations of actual type and derived type, an automatic\nrepreparation of the statement is triggered, to ensure closer\ncompatibility with previous versions of MySQL. Repreparation does not\noccur if any of the following conditions are true:\n\no NULL is used as the actual parameter value.\n\no A parameter is an operand of a CAST(). (Instead, a cast to the\n  derived type is attempted, and an exception raised if the cast\n  fails.)\n\no A parameter is a string. (In this case, an implicit CAST(? AS\n  derived_type) is performed.)\n\no The derived type and actual type of the parameter are both INTEGER\n  and have the same sign.\n\no The parameter\'s derived type is DECIMAL and its actual type is either\n  DECIMAL or INTEGER.\n\no The derived type is DOUBLE and the actual type is any numeric type.\n\no Both the derived type and the actual type are string types.\n\no If the derived type is temporal and the actual type is temporal.\n  Exceptions: The derived type is TIME and the actual type is not TIME;\n  the derived type is DATE and the actual type is not DATE.\n\no The derived type is temporal and the actual type is numeric.\n\nFor cases other than those just listed, the statement is reprepared and\nthe actual parameter types are used instead of the derived parameter\ntypes.\n\nThese rules also apply to a user variable referenced in a prepared\nstatement.\n\nUsing a different data type for a given parameter or user variable\nwithin a prepared statement for executions of the statement subsequent\nto the first execution causes the statement to be reprepared. This is\nless efficient; it may also lead to the parameter\'s (or variable\'s)\nactual type to vary, and thus for results to be inconsistent, with\nsubsequent executions of the prepared statement. For these reasons, it\nis advisable to use the same data type for a given parameter when\nre-executing a prepared statement.\n\nURL: https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.4/en/prepare.html\n\n','','https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.4/en/prepare.html'),(581,'EXECUTE STATEMENT',44,'Syntax:\nEXECUTE stmt_name\n    [USING @var_name [, @var_name] ...]\n\nAfter preparing a statement with PREPARE, you execute it with an\nEXECUTE statement that refers to the prepared statement name.

CONDITION indicates the specific\ncondition or class of conditions to associate with the condition name.\nIt can take the following forms:\n\no mysql_error_code: An integer literal indicating a MySQL error code.\n\n  Do not use MySQL error code 0 because that indicates success rather\n  than an error condition. For a list of MySQL error codes, see Server\n  Error Message Reference\n  (https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-errors/8.4/en/server-error-reference\n  .html).\n\no SQLSTATE [VALUE] sqlstate_value: A 5-character string literal\n  indicating an SQLSTATE value.\n\n  Do not use SQLSTATE values that begin with \'00\' because those\n  indicate success rather than an error condition. For a list of\n  SQLSTATE values, see Server Error Message Reference\n  (https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-errors/8.4/en/server-error-reference\n  .html).\n\nCondition names referred to in SIGNAL or use RESIGNAL statements must\nbe associated with SQLSTATE values, not MySQL error codes.\n\nURL: https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.4/en/declare-condition.html\n\n','','https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.4/en/declare-condition.html'),(600,'DECLARE HANDLER',45,'Syntax:\nDECLARE handler_action HANDLER\n    FOR condition_value [, condition_value] ...\n    statement\n\nhandler_action: {\n    CONTINUE\n  | EXIT\n  | UNDO\n}\n\ncondition_value: {\n    mysql_error_code\n  | SQLSTATE [VALUE] sqlstate_value\n  | condition_name\n  | SQLWARNING\n  | NOT FOUND\n  | SQLEXCEPTION\n}\n\nThe DECLARE ... HANDLER statement specifies a handler that deals with\none or more conditions. If one of these conditions occurs, the\nspecified statement executes. statement can be a simple statement such\nas SET var_name = value, or a compound statement written using BEGIN\nand END (see [HELP BEGIN END]).\n\nHandler declarations must appear after variable or condition\ndeclarations.\n\nThe handler_action value indicates what action the handler takes after\nexecution of the handler statement:\n\no CONTINUE: Execution of the current program continues.\n\no EXIT: Execution terminates for the BEGIN ...

HANDLER indicates the specific\ncondition or class of conditions that activates the handler. It can\ntake the following forms:\n\no mysql_error_code: An integer literal indicating a MySQL error code,\n  such as 1051 to specify \"unknown table\":\n\nDECLARE CONTINUE HANDLER FOR 1051\n  BEGIN\n    -- body of handler\n  END;\n\n  Do not use MySQL error code 0 because that indicates success rather\n  than an error condition.

This is relevant within the context of cursors and is used to\n  control what happens when a cursor reaches the end of a data set. If\n  no more rows are available, a No Data condition occurs with SQLSTATE\n  value \'02000\'. To detect this condition, you can set up a handler for\n  it or for a NOT FOUND condition.\n\nDECLARE CONTINUE HANDLER FOR NOT FOUND\n  BEGIN\n    -- body of handler\n  END;\n\n  For another example, see\n  https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.4/en/cursors.html.

If the program was called by another stored program, the\n  calling program handles the condition using the handler selection\n  rules applied to its own handlers.\n\no For SQLWARNING conditions, the program continues executing, as if\n  there were a CONTINUE handler.\n\no For NOT FOUND conditions, if the condition was raised normally, the\n  action is CONTINUE. If it was raised by SIGNAL or RESIGNAL, the\n  action is EXIT.\n\nURL: https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.4/en/declare-handler.html\n\n','mysql> CREATE TABLE test.t (s1 INT, PRIMARY KEY (s1));\nQuery OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)\n\nmysql> delimiter //\n\nmysql> CREATE PROCEDURE handlerdemo ()\n       BEGIN\n         DECLARE CONTINUE HANDLER FOR SQLSTATE \'23000\' SET @x2 = 1;\n         SET @x = 1;\n         INSERT INTO test.t VALUES (1);\n         SET @x = 2;\n         INSERT INTO test.t VALUES (1);\n         SET @x = 3;\n       END;\n       //\nQuery OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)\n\nmysql> CALL handlerdemo()//\nQuery OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)\n\nmysql> SELECT @x//\n    +------+\n    | @x   |\n    +------+\n    | 3    |\n    +------+\n    1 row in set (0.00 sec)\n','https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.4/en/declare-handler.html'),(601,'GET DIAGNOSTICS',45,'Syntax:\nGET [CURRENT | STACKED] DIAGNOSTICS {\n    statement_information_item\n    [, statement_information_item] ...\n  | CONDITION condition_number\n    condition_information_item\n    [, condition_information_item] ...\n}\n\nstatement_information_item:\n    target = statement_information_item_name\n\ncondition_information_item:\n    target = condition_information_item_name\n\nstatement_information_item_name: {\n    NUMBER\n  | ROW_COUNT\n}\n\ncondition_information_item_name: {\n    CLASS_ORIGIN\n  | SUBCLASS_ORIGIN\n  | RETURNED_SQLSTATE\n  | MESSAGE_TEXT\n  | MYSQL_ERRNO\n  | CONSTRAINT_CATALOG\n  | CONSTRAINT_SCHEMA\n  | CONSTRAINT_NAME\n  | CATALOG_NAME\n  | SCHEMA_NAME\n  | TABLE_NAME\n  | COLUMN_NAME\n  | CURSOR_NAME\n}\n\ncondition_number, target:\n    (see following discussion)\n\nSQL statements produce diagnostic information that populates the\ndiagnostics area. The GET DIAGNOSTICS statement enables applications to\ninspect this information. (You can also use SHOW WARNINGS or SHOW\nERRORS to see conditions or errors.)\n\nNo special privileges are required to execute GET DIAGNOSTICS.\n\nThe keyword CURRENT means to retrieve information from the current\ndiagnostics area. The keyword STACKED means to retrieve information\nfrom the second diagnostics area, which is available only if the\ncurrent context is a condition handler. If neither keyword is given,\nthe default is to use the current diagnostics area.\n\nThe GET DIAGNOSTICS statement is typically used in a handler within a\nstored program. It is a MySQL extension that GET [CURRENT] DIAGNOSTICS\nis permitted outside handler context to check the execution of any SQL\nstatement. For example, if you invoke the mysql client program, you can\nenter these statements at the prompt:\n\nmysql> DROP TABLE test.no_such_table;\nERROR 1051 (42S02): Unknown table \'test.no_such_table\'\nmysql> GET DIAGNOSTICS CONDITION 1\n         @p1 = RETURNED_SQLSTATE, @p2 = MESSAGE_TEXT;\nmysql> SELECT @p1, @p2;\n+-------+------------------------------------+\n| @p1   | @p2                                |\n+-------+------------------------------------+\n| 42S02 | Unknown table \'test.no_such_table\' |\n+-------+------------------------------------+\n\nThis extension applies only to the current diagnostics area. It does\nnot apply to the second diagnostics area because GET STACKED\nDIAGNOSTICS is permitted only if the current context is a condition\nhandler. If that is not the case, a GET STACKED DIAGNOSTICS when\nhandler not active error occurs.\n\nFor a description of the diagnostics area, see\nhttps://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.4/en/diagnostics-area.html. Briefly,\nit contains two kinds of information:\n\no Statement information, such as the number of conditions that occurred\n  or the affected-rows count.\n\no Condition information, such as the error code and message. If a\n  statement raises multiple conditions, this part of the diagnostics\n  area has a condition area for each one. If a statement raises no\n  conditions, this part of the diagnostics area is empty.\n\nFor a statement that produces three conditions, the diagnostics area\ncontains statement and condition information like this:\n\nStatement information:\n  row count\n  ... other statement information items ...\nCondition area list:\n  Condition area 1:\n    error code for condition 1\n    error message for condition 1\n    ... other condition information items ...\n  Condition area 2:\n    error code for condition 2:\n    error message for condition 2\n    ... other condition information items ...\n  Condition area 3:\n    error code for condition 3\n    error message for condition 3\n    ... other condition information items ...\n\nGET DIAGNOSTICS can obtain either statement or condition information,\nbut not both in the same statement:\n\no To obtain statement information, retrieve the desired statement items\n  into target variables. This instance of GET DIAGNOSTICS assigns the\n  number of available conditions and the rows-affected count to the\n  user variables @p1 and @p2:\n\nGET DIAGNOSTICS @p1 = NUMBER, @p2 = ROW_COUNT;\n\no To obtain condition information, specify the condition number and\n  retrieve the desired condition items into target variables. This\n  instance of GET DIAGNOSTICS assigns the SQLSTATE value and error\n  message to the user variables @p3 and @p4:\n\nGET DIAGNOSTICS CONDITION 1\n  @p3 = RETURNED_SQLSTATE, @p4 = MESSAGE_TEXT;\n\nThe retrieval list specifies one or more target = item_name\nassignments, separated by commas. Each assignment names a target\nvariable and either a statement_information_item_name or\ncondition_information_item_name designator, depending on whether the\nstatement retrieves statement or condition information.\n\nValid target designators for storing item information can be stored\nprocedure or function parameters, stored program local variables\ndeclared with DECLARE, or user-defined variables.\n\nValid condition_number designators can be stored procedure or function\nparameters, stored program local variables declared with DECLARE,\nuser-defined variables, system variables, or literals. A character\nliteral may include a _charset introducer. A warning occurs if the\ncondition number is not in the range from 1 to the number of condition\nareas that have information. In this case, the warning is added to the\ndiagnostics area without clearing it.\n\nWhen a condition occurs, MySQL does not populate all condition items\nrecognized by GET DIAGNOSTICS. For example:\n\nmysql> GET DIAGNOSTICS CONDITION 1\n         @p5 = SCHEMA_NAME, @p6 = TABLE_NAME;\nmysql> SELECT @p5, @p6;\n+------+------+\n| @p5  | @p6  |\n+------+------+\n|      |      |\n+------+------+\n\nIn standard SQL, if there are multiple conditions, the first condition\nrelates to the SQLSTATE value returned for the previous SQL statement.\nIn MySQL, this is not guaranteed. To get the main error, you cannot do\nthis:\n\nGET DIAGNOSTICS CONDITION 1 @errno = MYSQL_ERRNO;\n\nInstead, retrieve the condition count first, then use it to specify\nwhich condition number to inspect:\n\nGET DIAGNOSTICS @cno = NUMBER;\nGET DIAGNOSTICS CONDITION @cno @errno = MYSQL_ERRNO;\n\nFor information about permissible statement and condition information\nitems, and which ones are populated when a condition occurs, see\nhttps://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.4/en/diagnostics-area.html#diagnosti\ncs-area-information-items.\n\nHere is an example that uses GET DIAGNOSTICS and an exception handler\nin stored procedure context to assess the outcome of an insert\noperation. If the insert was successful, the procedure uses GET\nDIAGNOSTICS to get the rows-affected count. This shows that you can use\nGET DIAGNOSTICS multiple times to retrieve information about a\nstatement as long as the current diagnostics area has not been cleared.\n\nCREATE PROCEDURE do_insert(value INT)\nBEGIN\n  -- Declare variables to hold diagnostics area information\n  DECLARE code CHAR(5) DEFAULT \'00000\';\n  DECLARE msg TEXT;\n  DECLARE nrows INT;\n  DECLARE result TEXT;\n  -- Declare exception handler for failed insert\n  DECLARE CONTINUE HANDLER FOR SQLEXCEPTION\n    BEGIN\n      GET DIAGNOSTICS CONDITION 1\n        code = RETURNED_SQLSTATE, msg = MESSAGE_TEXT;\n    END;\n\n  -- Perform the insert\n  INSERT INTO t1 (int_col) VALUES(value);\n  -- Check whether the insert was successful\n  IF code = \'00000\' THEN\n    GET DIAGNOSTICS nrows = ROW_COUNT;\n    SET result = CONCAT(\'insert succeeded, row count = \',nrows);\n  ELSE\n    SET result = CONCAT(\'insert failed, error = \',code,\', message = \',msg);\n  END IF;\n  -- Say what happened\n  SELECT result;\nEND;\n\nSuppose that t1.int_col is an integer column that is declared as NOT\nNULL.
