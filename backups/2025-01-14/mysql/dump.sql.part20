Otherwise, the statement executes\n  as usual, and attempting to revoke a privilege not assigned to the\n  target for whatever reason raises an error, as expected.\n\n  Example (continuing from the previous example):\n\nmysql> DROP USER IF EXISTS jerry@localhost;\nQuery OK, 0 rows affected (0.01 sec)\n\nmysql> REVOKE SELECT ON test.t1 FROM jerry@localhost;\nERROR 1147 (42000): There is no such grant defined for user \'jerry\' on host\n\'localhost\' on table \'t1\' \nmysql> REVOKE SELECT ON test.t1 FROM jerry@localhost IGNORE UNKNOWN USER;\nQuery OK, 0 rows affected, 1 warning (0.01 sec)\n\nmysql> SHOW WARNINGS\\G\n*************************** 1. row ***************************\n  Level: Warning\n   Code: 3162\nMessage: Authorization ID jerry does not exist.\n1 row in set (0.00 sec)\n\no The combination of IF EXISTS and IGNORE UNKNOWN USER means that\n  REVOKE never raises an error for an unknown target user or role or\n  for an unassigned or unavailable privilege, and the statement as\n  whole in such cases succeeds; roles or privileges are removed from\n  existing target users or roles whenever possible, and any revocation\n  which is not possible raises a warning and executes as a NOOP.\n\n  Example (again continuing from example in the previous item):\n\n# No such user, no such role\nmysql> DROP ROLE IF EXISTS Bogus;\nQuery OK, 0 rows affected, 1 warning (0.02 sec)\n\nmysql> SHOW WARNINGS;\n+-------+------+----------------------------------------------+\n| Level | Code | Message                                      |\n+-------+------+----------------------------------------------+\n| Note  | 3162 | Authorization ID \'Bogus\'@\'%\' does not exist. |\n+-------+------+----------------------------------------------+\n1 row in set (0.00 sec)\n\n# This statement attempts to revoke a nonexistent role from a nonexistent user\nmysql> REVOKE Bogus ON test FROM jerry@localhost;\nERROR 3619 (HY000): Illegal privilege level specified for test\n\n# The same, with IF EXISTS\nmysql> REVOKE IF EXISTS Bogus ON test FROM jerry@localhost;\nERROR 1147 (42000): There is no such grant defined for user \'jerry\' on host\n\'localhost\' on table \'test\' \n\n# The same, with IGNORE UNKNOWN USER\nmysql> REVOKE Bogus ON test FROM jerry@localhost IGNORE UNKNOWN USER;\nERROR 3619 (HY000): Illegal privilege level specified for test\n\n# The same, with both options\nmysql> REVOKE IF EXISTS Bogus ON test FROM jerry@localhost IGNORE UNKNOWN USER;\nQuery OK, 0 rows affected, 2 warnings (0.01 sec)\n\nmysql> SHOW WARNINGS;\n+---------+------+--------------------------------------------+\n| Level   | Code | Message                                    |\n+---------+------+--------------------------------------------+\n| Warning | 3619 | Illegal privilege level specified for test |\n| Warning | 3162 | Authorization ID jerry does not exist.     |\n+---------+------+--------------------------------------------+\n2 rows in set (0.00 sec)\n\nRoles named in the mandatory_roles system variable value cannot be\nrevoked. When IF EXISTS and IGNORE UNKNOWN USER are used together in a\nstatement that tries to remove a mandatory privilege, the error\nnormally raised by attempting to do this is demoted to a warning; the\nstatement executes successfully, but does not make any changes.\n\nA revoked role immediately affects any user account from which it was\nrevoked, such that within any current session for the account, its\nprivileges are adjusted for the next statement executed.\n\nRevoking a role revokes the role itself, not the privileges that it\nrepresents. Suppose that an account is granted a role that includes a\ngiven privilege, and is also granted the privilege explicitly or\nanother role that includes the privilege. In this case, the account\nstill possesses that privilege if the first role is revoked. For\nexample, if an account is granted two roles that each include SELECT,\nthe account still can select after either role is revoked.\n\nREVOKE ALL ON *.* (at the global level) revokes all granted static\nglobal privileges and all granted dynamic privileges.\n\nA revoked privilege that is granted but not known to the server is\nrevoked with a warning. This situation can occur for dynamic\nprivileges. For example, a dynamic privilege can be granted while the\ncomponent that registers it is installed, but if that component is\nsubsequently uninstalled, the privilege becomes unregistered, although\naccounts that possess the privilege still possess it and it can be\nrevoked from them.\n\nURL: https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.4/en/revoke.html\n\n','','https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.4/en/revoke.html'),(612,'SET DEFAULT ROLE',46,'Syntax:\nSET DEFAULT ROLE\n    {NONE | ALL | role [, role ] ...}\n    TO user [, user ] ...\n\nFor each user named immediately after the TO keyword, this statement\ndefines which roles become active when the user connects to the server\nand authenticates, or when the user executes the SET ROLE DEFAULT\nstatement during a session.\n\nSET DEFAULT ROLE is alternative syntax for ALTER USER ...

(Exception: If the new password specified by the\n  SET PASSWORD statement is empty, the secondary password becomes empty\n  as well, even if RETAIN CURRENT PASSWORD is given.)\n\no If you specify RETAIN CURRENT PASSWORD for an account that has an\n  empty primary password, the statement fails.\n\no If an account has a secondary password and you change its primary\n  password without specifying RETAIN CURRENT PASSWORD, the secondary\n  password remains unchanged.\n\nFor more information about use of dual passwords, see\nhttps://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.4/en/password-management.html.\n\nSET PASSWORD permits these auth_option syntaxes:\n\no = \'auth_string\'\n\n  Assigns the account the given literal password.\n\no TO RANDOM\n\n  Assigns the account a password randomly generated by MySQL.
