A session can acquire or\nrelease locks only for itself. One session cannot acquire locks for\nanother session or release locks held by another session.\n\nLocks may be used to emulate transactions or to get more speed when\nupdating tables. This is explained in more detail in\nhttps://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.4/en/lock-tables.html#lock-tables-re\nstrictions.\n\nLOCK TABLES explicitly acquires table locks for the current client\nsession. Table locks can be acquired for base tables or views. You must\nhave the LOCK TABLES privilege, and the SELECT privilege for each\nobject to be locked.\n\nFor view locking, LOCK TABLES adds all base tables used in the view to\nthe set of tables to be locked and locks them automatically. For tables\nunderlying any view being locked, LOCK TABLES checks that the view\ndefiner (for SQL SECURITY DEFINER views) or invoker (for all views) has\nthe proper privileges on the tables.\n\nIf you lock a table explicitly with LOCK TABLES, any tables used in\ntriggers are also locked implicitly, as described in\nhttps://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.4/en/lock-tables.html#lock-tables-an\nd-triggers.\n\nIf you lock a table explicitly with LOCK TABLES, any tables related by\na foreign key constraint are opened and locked implicitly. For foreign\nkey checks, a shared read-only lock (LOCK TABLES READ) is taken on\nrelated tables. For cascading updates, a shared-nothing write lock\n(LOCK TABLES WRITE) is taken on related tables that are involved in the\noperation.\n\nUNLOCK TABLES explicitly releases any table locks held by the current\nsession. LOCK TABLES implicitly releases any table locks held by the\ncurrent session before acquiring new locks.\n\nAnother use for UNLOCK TABLES is to release the global read lock\nacquired with the FLUSH TABLES WITH READ LOCK statement, which enables\nyou to lock all tables in all databases. See [HELP FLUSH]. (This is a\nvery convenient way to get backups if you have a file system such as\nVeritas that can take snapshots in time.)\n\nLOCK TABLE is a synonym for LOCK TABLES; UNLOCK TABLE is a synonym for\nUNLOCK TABLES.\n\nURL: https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.4/en/lock-tables.html\n\n','','https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.4/en/lock-tables.html'),(570,'SET TRANSACTION',42,'Syntax:\nSET [GLOBAL | SESSION] TRANSACTION\n    transaction_characteristic [, transaction_characteristic] ...\n\ntransaction_characteristic: {\n    ISOLATION LEVEL level\n  | access_mode\n}\n\nlevel: {\n     REPEATABLE READ\n   | READ COMMITTED\n   | READ UNCOMMITTED\n   | SERIALIZABLE\n}\n\naccess_mode: {\n     READ WRITE\n   | READ ONLY\n}\n\nThis statement specifies transaction characteristics.

An xid is an XA transaction identifier. It indicates\nwhich transaction the statement applies to. xid values are supplied by\nthe client, or generated by the MySQL server. An xid value has from one\nto three parts:\n\nxid: gtrid [, bqual [, formatID ]]\n\ngtrid is a global transaction identifier, bqual is a branch qualifier,\nand formatID is a number that identifies the format used by the gtrid\nand bqual values. As indicated by the syntax, bqual and formatID are\noptional. The default bqual value is \'\' if not given. The default\nformatID value is 1 if not given.\n\ngtrid and bqual must be string literals, each up to 64 bytes (not\ncharacters) long. gtrid and bqual can be specified in several ways. You\ncan use a quoted string (\'ab\'), hex string (X\'6162\', 0x6162), or bit\nvalue (b\'nnnn\').\n\nformatID is an unsigned integer.\n\nThe gtrid and bqual values are interpreted in bytes by the MySQL\nserver\'s underlying XA support routines. However, while an SQL\nstatement containing an XA statement is being parsed, the server works\nwith some specific character set. To be safe, write gtrid and bqual as\nhex strings.\n\nxid values typically are generated by the Transaction Manager. Values\ngenerated by one TM must be different from values generated by other\nTMs. A given TM must be able to recognize its own xid values in a list\nof values returned by the XA RECOVER statement.\n\nXA START xid starts an XA transaction with the given xid value. Each XA\ntransaction must have a unique xid value, so the value must not\ncurrently be used by another XA transaction. Uniqueness is assessed\nusing the gtrid and bqual values. All following XA statements for the\nXA transaction must be specified using the same xid value as that given\nin the XA START statement. If you use any of those statements but\nspecify an xid value that does not correspond to some existing XA\ntransaction, an error occurs.\n\nXA START, XA BEGIN, XA END, XA COMMIT, and XA ROLLBACK statements are\nnot filtered by the default database when the server is running with\n--replicate-do-db or --replicate-ignore-db.\n\nOne or more XA transactions can be part of the same global transaction.\nAll XA transactions within a given global transaction must use the same\ngtrid value in the xid value. For this reason, gtrid values must be\nglobally unique so that there is no ambiguity about which global\ntransaction a given XA transaction is part of. The bqual part of the\nxid value must be different for each XA transaction within a global\ntransaction. (The requirement that bqual values be different is a\nlimitation of the current MySQL XA implementation. It is not part of\nthe XA specification.)\n\nThe XA RECOVER statement returns information for those XA transactions\non the MySQL server that are in the PREPARED state. (See\nhttps://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.4/en/xa-states.html.) The output\nincludes a row for each such XA transaction on the server, regardless\nof which client started it.\n\nXA RECOVER requires the XA_RECOVER_ADMIN privilege. This privilege\nrequirement prevents users from discovering the XID values for\noutstanding prepared XA transactions other than their own. It does not\naffect normal commit or rollback of an XA transaction because the user\nwho started it knows its XID.\n\nXA RECOVER output rows look like this (for an example xid value\nconsisting of the parts \'abc\', \'def\', and 7):\n\nmysql> XA RECOVER;\n+----------+--------------+--------------+--------+\n| formatID | gtrid_length | bqual_length | data   |\n+----------+--------------+--------------+--------+\n|        7 |            3 |            3 | abcdef |\n+----------+--------------+--------------+--------+\n\nThe output columns have the following meanings:\n\no formatID is the formatID part of the transaction xid\n\no gtrid_length is the length in bytes of the gtrid part of the xid\n\no bqual_length is the length in bytes of the bqual part of the xid\n\no data is the concatenation of the gtrid and bqual parts of the xid\n\nXID values may contain nonprintable characters.

Filters applied without a specific FOR CHANNEL clause are\nconsidered global filters, meaning that they are applied to all\nreplication channels.\n\nGlobal replication filters cannot be set on a MySQL server instance\nthat is configured for Group Replication, because filtering\ntransactions on some servers would make the group unable to reach\nagreement on a consistent state. Channel specific replication filters\ncan be set on replication channels that are not directly involved with\nGroup Replication, such as where a group member also acts as a replica\nto a source that is outside the group. They cannot be set on the\ngroup_replication_applier or group_replication_recovery channels.\n\nThe following list shows the CHANGE REPLICATION FILTER options and how\nthey relate to --replicate-* server options:\n\no REPLICATE_DO_DB: Include updates based on database name. Equivalent\n  to --replicate-do-db.\n\no REPLICATE_IGNORE_DB: Exclude updates based on database name.\n  Equivalent to --replicate-ignore-db.\n\no REPLICATE_DO_TABLE: Include updates based on table name. Equivalent\n  to --replicate-do-table.\n\no REPLICATE_IGNORE_TABLE: Exclude updates based on table name.\n  Equivalent to --replicate-ignore-table.\n\no REPLICATE_WILD_DO_TABLE: Include updates based on wildcard pattern\n  matching table name. Equivalent to --replicate-wild-do-table.\n\no REPLICATE_WILD_IGNORE_TABLE: Exclude updates based on wildcard\n  pattern matching table name. Equivalent to\n  --replicate-wild-ignore-table.\n\no REPLICATE_REWRITE_DB: Perform updates on replica after substituting\n  new name on replica for specified database on source. Equivalent to\n  --replicate-rewrite-db.\n\nThe precise effects of REPLICATE_DO_DB and REPLICATE_IGNORE_DB filters\nare dependent on whether statement-based or row-based replication is in\neffect. See\nhttps://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.4/en/replication-rules.html, for\nmore information.\n\nMultiple replication filtering rules can be created in a single CHANGE\nREPLICATION FILTER statement by separating the rules with commas, as\nshown here:\n\nCHANGE REPLICATION FILTER\n    REPLICATE_DO_DB = (d1), REPLICATE_IGNORE_DB = (d2);\n\nIssuing the statement just shown is equivalent to starting the replica\nmysqld with the options --replicate-do-db=d1 --replicate-ignore-db=d2.\n\nOn a multi-source replica, which uses multiple replication channels to\nprocess transaction from different sources, use the FOR CHANNEL channel\nclause to set a replication filter on a replication channel:\n\nCHANGE REPLICATION FILTER REPLICATE_DO_DB = (d1) FOR CHANNEL channel_1;\n\nThis enables you to create a channel specific replication filter to\nfilter out selected data from a source. When a FOR CHANNEL clause is\nprovided, the replication filter statement acts on that replication\nchannel, removing any existing replication filter which has the same\nfilter type as the specified replication filters, and replacing them\nwith the specified filter. Filter types not explicitly listed in the\nstatement are not modified. If issued against a replication channel\nwhich is not configured, the statement fails with an\nER_SLAVE_CONFIGURATION error. If issued against Group Replication\nchannels, the statement fails with an\nER_SLAVE_CHANNEL_OPERATION_NOT_ALLOWED error.\n\nOn a replica with multiple replication channels configured, issuing\nCHANGE REPLICATION FILTER with no FOR CHANNEL clause configures the\nreplication filter for every configured replication channel, and for\nthe global replication filters. For every filter type, if the filter\ntype is listed in the statement, then any existing filter rules of that\ntype are replaced by the filter rules specified in the most recently\nissued statement, otherwise the old value of the filter type is\nretained. For more information see\nhttps://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.4/en/replication-rules-channel-based\n-filters.html.\n\nIf the same filtering rule is specified multiple times, only the last\nsuch rule is actually used. For example, the two statements shown here\nhave exactly the same effect, because the first REPLICATE_DO_DB rule in\nthe first statement is ignored:\n\nCHANGE REPLICATION FILTER\n    REPLICATE_DO_DB = (db1, db2), REPLICATE_DO_DB = (db3, db4);\n\nCHANGE REPLICATION FILTER\n    REPLICATE_DO_DB = (db3, db4);\n\n*Caution*:\n\nThis behavior differs from that of the --replicate-* filter options\nwhere specifying the same option multiple times causes the creation of\nmultiple filter rules.\n\nNames of tables and database not containing any special characters need\nnot be quoted. Values used with REPLICATION_WILD_TABLE and\nREPLICATION_WILD_IGNORE_TABLE are string expressions, possibly\ncontaining (special) wildcard characters, and so must be quoted. This\nis shown in the following example statements:\n\nCHANGE REPLICATION FILTER\n    REPLICATE_WILD_DO_TABLE = (\'db1.old%\');\n\nCHANGE REPLICATION FILTER\n    REPLICATE_WILD_IGNORE_TABLE = (\'db1.new%\', \'db2.new%\');\n\nValues used with REPLICATE_REWRITE_DB represent pairs of database\nnames; each such value must be enclosed in parentheses. The following\nstatement rewrites statements occurring on database db1 on the source\nto database db2 on the replica:\n\nCHANGE REPLICATION FILTER REPLICATE_REWRITE_DB = ((db1, db2));\n\nThe statement just shown contains two sets of parentheses, one\nenclosing the pair of database names, and the other enclosing the\nentire list. This is perhaps more easily seen in the following example,\nwhich creates two rewrite-db rules, one rewriting database dbA to dbB,\nand one rewriting database dbC to dbD:\n\nCHANGE REPLICATION FILTER\n  REPLICATE_REWRITE_DB = ((dbA, dbB), (dbC, dbD));\n\nThe CHANGE REPLICATION FILTER statement replaces replication filtering\nrules only for the filter types and replication channels affected by\nthe statement, and leaves other rules and channels unchanged. If you\nwant to unset all filters of a given type, set the filter\'s value to an\nexplicitly empty list, as shown in this example, which removes all\nexisting REPLICATE_DO_DB and REPLICATE_IGNORE_DB rules:\n\nCHANGE REPLICATION FILTER\n    REPLICATE_DO_DB = (), REPLICATE_IGNORE_DB = ();\n\nSetting a filter to empty in this way removes all existing rules, does\nnot create any new ones, and does not restore any rules set at mysqld\nstartup using --replicate-* options on the command line or in the\nconfiguration file.\n\nThe RESET REPLICA ALL statement removes channel specific replication\nfilters that were set on channels deleted by the statement. When the\ndeleted channel or channels are recreated, any global replication\nfilters specified for the replica are copied to them, and no channel\nspecific replication filters are applied.\n\nFor more information, see\nhttps://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.4/en/replication-rules.html.\n\nURL: https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.4/en/change-replication-filter.html\n\n','','https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.4/en/change-replication-filter.html'),(576,'CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO',43,'Syntax:\nCHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO option [, option] ...

It also updates the contents of the replication metadata\nrepositories (see\nhttps://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.4/en/replica-logs.html).\n\nCHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO requires the REPLICATION_SLAVE_ADMIN\nprivilege (or the deprecated SUPER privilege).\n\nOptions that you do not specify on a CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO\nstatement retain their value, except as indicated in the following\ndiscussion. In most cases, there is therefore no need to specify\noptions that do not change.\n\nValues used for SOURCE_HOST and other CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO\noptions are checked for linefeed (\\n or 0x0A) characters. The presence\nof such characters in these values causes the statement to fail with an\nerror.\n\nThe optional FOR CHANNEL channel clause lets you name which replication\nchannel the statement applies to. Providing a FOR CHANNEL channel\nclause applies the CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO statement to a specific\nreplication channel, and is used to add a new channel or modify an\nexisting channel. For example, to add a new channel called channel2:\n\nCHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO SOURCE_HOST=host1, SOURCE_PORT=3002 FOR CHANNEL \'channel2\';\n\nIf no clause is named and no extra channels exist, a CHANGE REPLICATION\nSOURCE TO statement applies to the default channel, whose name is the\nempty string (\"\"). When you have set up multiple replication channels,\nevery CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO statement must name a channel using\nthe FOR CHANNEL channel clause. See\nhttps://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.4/en/replication-channels.html for\nmore information.\n\nFor some of the options of the CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO statement,\nyou must issue a STOP REPLICA statement prior to issuing a CHANGE\nREPLICATION SOURCE TO statement (and a START REPLICA statement\nafterwards). Sometimes, you only need to stop the replication SQL\n(applier) thread or the replication I/O (receiver) thread, not both:\n\no When the applier thread is stopped, you can execute CHANGE\n  REPLICATION SOURCE TO using any combination that is otherwise allowed\n  of RELAY_LOG_FILE, RELAY_LOG_POS, and SOURCE_DELAY options, even if\n  the replication receiver thread is running. No other options may be\n  used with this statement when the receiver thread is running.\n\no When the receiver thread is stopped, you can execute CHANGE\n  REPLICATION SOURCE TO using any of the options for this statement (in\n  any allowed combination) except RELAY_LOG_FILE, RELAY_LOG_POS,\n  SOURCE_DELAY, or SOURCE_AUTO_POSITION = 1 even when the applier\n  thread is running.\n\no Both the receiver thread and the applier thread must be stopped\n  before issuing a CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO statement that employs\n  SOURCE_AUTO_POSITION = 1, GTID_ONLY = 1, or\n  ASSIGN_GTIDS_TO_ANONYMOUS_TRANSACTIONS.\n\nYou can check the current state of the replication applier thread and\nreplication receiver thread using SHOW REPLICA STATUS. Note that the\nGroup Replication applier channel (group_replication_applier) has no\nreceiver thread, only an applier thread.\n\nCHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO statements have a number of side-effects\nand interactions that you should be aware of beforehand:\n\no CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO causes an implicit commit of an ongoing\n  transaction. See\n  https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.4/en/implicit-commit.html.\n\no CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO causes the previous values for\n  SOURCE_HOST, SOURCE_PORT, SOURCE_LOG_FILE, and SOURCE_LOG_POS to be\n  written to the error log, along with other information about the\n  replica\'s state prior to execution.\n\no If you are using statement-based replication and temporary tables, it\n  is possible for a CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO statement following a\n  STOP REPLICA statement to leave behind temporary tables on the\n  replica. A warning (ER_WARN_OPEN_TEMP_TABLES_MUST_BE_ZERO\n  (https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-errors/8.4/en/server-error-reference\n  .html#error_er_warn_open_temp_tables_must_be_zero)) is issued\n  whenever this occurs. You can avoid this in such cases by making sure\n  that the value of the Replica_open_temp_tables system status variable\n  is equal to 0 prior to executing such a CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO\n  statement.\n\no When using a multithreaded replica (replica_parallel_workers > 0),\n  stopping the replica can cause gaps in the sequence of transactions\n  that have been executed from the relay log, regardless of whether the\n  replica was stopped intentionally or otherwise. In MySQL 8.4, these\n  can be resolved using GTID auto-positioning.\n\nThe following options are available for CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO\nstatements:\n\no ASSIGN_GTIDS_TO_ANONYMOUS_TRANSACTIONS = {OFF | LOCAL | uuid}\n\n  Makes the replication channel assign a GTID to replicated\n  transactions that do not have one, enabling replication from a source\n  that does not use GTID-based replication, to a replica that does. For\n  a multi-source replica, you can have a mix of channels that use\n  ASSIGN_GTIDS_TO_ANONYMOUS_TRANSACTIONS, and channels that do not. The\n  default is OFF, meaning that the feature is not used.\n\n  LOCAL assigns a GTID including the replica\'s own UUID (the\n  server_uuid setting). uuid assigns a GTID including the specified\n  UUID, such as the server_uuid setting for the replication source\n  server. Using a nonlocal UUID lets you differentiate between\n  transactions that originated on the replica and transactions that\n  originated on the source, and for a multi-source replica, between\n  transactions that originated on different sources. The UUID you\n  choose only has significance for the replica\'s own use. If any of the\n  transactions sent by the source do have a GTID already, that GTID is\n  retained.\n\n  Channels specific to Group Replication cannot use\n  ASSIGN_GTIDS_TO_ANONYMOUS_TRANSACTIONS, but an asynchronous\n  replication channel for another source on a server instance that is a\n  Group Replication group member can do so. In that case, do not\n  specify the Group Replication group name as the UUID for creating the\n  GTIDs.\n\n  To set ASSIGN_GTIDS_TO_ANONYMOUS_TRANSACTIONS to LOCAL or uuid, the\n  replica must have gtid_mode=ON set, and this cannot be changed\n  afterwards. This option is for use with a source that has binary log\n  file position based replication, so SOURCE_AUTO_POSITION=1 cannot be\n  set for the channel. Both the replication SQL thread and the\n  replication I/O (receiver) thread must be stopped before setting this\n  option.\n\n  *Important*:\n\n  A replica set up with ASSIGN_GTIDS_TO_ANONYMOUS_TRANSACTIONS on any\n  channel cannot be promoted to replace the replication source server\n  in the event that a failover is required, and a backup taken from the\n  replica cannot be used to restore the replication source server. The\n  same restriction applies to replacing or restoring other replicas\n  that use ASSIGN_GTIDS_TO_ANONYMOUS_TRANSACTIONS on any channel.\n\n  For further restrictions and information, see\n  https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.4/en/replication-gtids-assign-anon\n  .html.\n\no GET_SOURCE_PUBLIC_KEY = {0|1}\n\n  Enables RSA key pair-based password exchange by requesting the public\n  key from the source. The option is disabled by default.\n\n  This option applies to replicas that authenticate with the\n  caching_sha2_password authentication plugin. For connections by\n  accounts that authenticate using this plugin, the source does not\n  send the public key unless requested, so it must be requested or\n  specified in the client. If SOURCE_PUBLIC_KEY_PATH is given and\n  specifies a valid public key file, it takes precedence over\n  GET_SOURCE_PUBLIC_KEY. If you are using a replication user account\n  that authenticates with the caching_sha2_password plugin (the\n  default), and you are not using a secure connection, you must specify\n  either this option or the SOURCE_PUBLIC_KEY_PATH option to provide\n  the RSA public key to the replica.\n\no GTID_ONLY = {0|1}\n\n  Stops the replication channel persisting file names and file\n  positions in the replication metadata repositories. GTID_ONLY is\n  disabled by default for asynchronous replication channels, but is\n  enabled by default for Group Replication channels, for which it\n  cannot be disabled.\n\n  For replication channels with this setting, in-memory file positions\n  are still tracked, and file positions can still be observed for\n  debugging purposes in error messages and through interfaces such as\n  SHOW REPLICA STATUS statements (where they are shown as being invalid\n  if they are out of date). However, the writes and reads required to\n  persist and check the file positions are avoided in situations where\n  GTID-based replication does not actually require them, including the\n  transaction queuing and application process.\n\n  This option can be used only if both the replication SQL (applier)\n  thread and replication I/O (receiver) thread are stopped. To set\n  GTID_ONLY = 1 for a replication channel, GTIDs must be in use on the\n  server (gtid_mode = ON), and row-based binary logging must be in use\n  on the source (statement-based replication is not supported). The\n  options REQUIRE_ROW_FORMAT = 1 and SOURCE_AUTO_POSITION = 1 must be\n  set for the replication channel.\n\n  When GTID_ONLY = 1 is set, the replica uses\n  replica_parallel_workers=1 if that system variable is set to zero for\n  the server, so it is always technically a multi-threaded applier.\n  This is because a multi-threaded applier uses saved positions rather\n  than the replication metadata repositories to locate the start of a\n  transaction that it needs to reapply.\n\n  If you disable GTID_ONLY after setting it, the existing relay logs\n  are deleted and the existing known binary log file positions are\n  persisted, even if they are stale. The file positions for the binary\n  log and relay log in the replication metadata repositories might be\n  invalid, and a warning is returned if this is the case. Provided that\n  SOURCE_AUTO_POSITION is still enabled, GTID auto-positioning is used\n  to provide the correct positioning.\n\n  If you also disable SOURCE_AUTO_POSITION, the file positions for the\n  binary log and relay log in the replication metadata repositories are\n  used for positioning if they are valid. If they are marked as\n  invalid, you must provide a valid binary log file name and position\n  (SOURCE_LOG_FILE and SOURCE_LOG_POS). If you also provide a relay log\n  file name and position (RELAY_LOG_FILE and RELAY_LOG_POS), the relay\n  logs are preserved and the applier position is set to the stated\n  position. GTID auto-skip ensures that any transactions already\n  applied are skipped even if the eventual applier position is not\n  correct.\n\no IGNORE_SERVER_IDS = (server_id_list)\n\n  Makes the replica ignore events originating from the specified\n  servers. The option takes a comma-separated list of 0 or more server\n  IDs. Log rotation and deletion events from the servers are not\n  ignored, and are recorded in the relay log.\n\n  In circular replication, the originating server normally acts as the\n  terminator of its own events, so that they are not applied more than\n  once. Thus, this option is useful in circular replication when one of\n  the servers in the circle is removed. Suppose that you have a\n  circular replication setup with 4 servers, having server IDs 1, 2, 3,\n  and 4, and server 3 fails. When bridging the gap by starting\n  replication from server 2 to server 4, you can include\n  IGNORE_SERVER_IDS = (3) in the CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO statement\n  that you issue on server 4 to tell it to use server 2 as its source\n  instead of server 3. Doing so causes it to ignore and not to\n  propagate any statements that originated with the server that is no\n  longer in use.\n\n  If IGNORE_SERVER_IDS contains the server\'s own ID and the server was\n  started with the --replicate-same-server-id option enabled, an error\n  results.\n\n  The source metadata repository and the output of SHOW REPLICA STATUS\n  provide the list of servers that are currently ignored. For more\n  information, see\n  https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.4/en/replica-logs-status.html, and\n  [HELP SHOW REPLICA STATUS].\n\n  If a CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO statement is issued without\n  IGNORE_SERVER_IDS, any existing list is preserved. To clear the list\n  of ignored servers, it is necessary to use the option with an empty\n  list, like this:\n\nCHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO IGNORE_SERVER_IDS = ();\n\n  RESET REPLICA ALL also clears IGNORE_SERVER_IDS.\n\n  When global t
