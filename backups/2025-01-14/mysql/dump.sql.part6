By default these functions implement AES with a 128-bit key\nlength. Key lengths of 196 or 256 bits can be used, as described later.\nThe key length is a trade off between performance and security.\n\nAES_ENCRYPT() encrypts the string str using the key string key_str, and\nreturns a binary string containing the encrypted output. AES_DECRYPT()\ndecrypts the encrypted string crypt_str using the key string key_str,\nand returns the original (binary) string in hexadecimal format. (To\nobtain the string as plaintext, cast the result to CHAR. Alternatively,\nstart the mysql client with --skip-binary-as-hex to cause all binary\nvalues to be displayed as text.) If either function argument is NULL,\nthe function returns NULL. If AES_DECRYPT() detects invalid data or\nincorrect padding, it returns NULL. However, it is possible for\nAES_DECRYPT() to return a non-NULL value (possibly garbage) if the\ninput data or the key is invalid.\n\nThese functions support the use of a key derivation function (KDF) to\ncreate a cryptographically strong secret key from the information\npassed in key_str. The derived key is used to encrypt and decrypt the\ndata, and it remains in the MySQL Server instance and is not accessible\nto users. Using a KDF is highly recommended, as it provides better\nsecurity than specifying your own premade key or deriving it by a\nsimpler method as you use the function. The functions support HKDF\n(available from OpenSSL 1.1.0), for which you can specify an optional\nsalt and context-specific information to include in the keying\nmaterial, and PBKDF2 (available from OpenSSL 1.0.2), for which you can\nspecify an optional salt and set the number of iterations used to\nproduce the key.\n\nAES_ENCRYPT() and AES_DECRYPT() permit control of the block encryption\nmode. The block_encryption_mode system variable controls the mode for\nblock-based encryption algorithms. Its default value is aes-128-ecb,\nwhich signifies encryption using a key length of 128 bits and ECB mode.\nFor a description of the permitted values of this variable, see\nhttps://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.4/en/server-system-variables.html.\nThe optional init_vector argument is used to provide an initialization\nvector for block encryption modes that require it.\n\nStatements that use AES_ENCRYPT() or AES_DECRYPT() are unsafe for\nstatement-based replication.\n\nIf AES_ENCRYPT() is invoked from within the mysql client, binary\nstrings display using hexadecimal notation, depending on the value of\nthe --binary-as-hex. For more information about that option, see\nhttps://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.4/en/mysql.html.\n\nThe arguments for the AES_ENCRYPT() and AES_DECRYPT() functions are as\nfollows:\n\no str\n\n  The string for AES_ENCRYPT() to encrypt using the key string key_str,\n  or the key derived from it by the specified KDF. The string can be\n  any length. Padding is automatically added to str so it is a multiple\n  of a block as required by block-based algorithms such as AES. This\n  padding is automatically removed by the AES_DECRYPT() function.\n\no crypt_str\n\n  The encrypted string for AES_DECRYPT() to decrypt using the key\n  string key_str, or the key derived from it by the specified KDF. The\n  string can be any length. The length of crypt_str can be calculated\n  from the length of the original string using this formula:\n\n16 * (trunc(string_length / 16) + 1)\n\no key_str\n\n  The encryption key, or the input keying material that is used as the\n  basis for deriving a key using a key derivation function (KDF). For\n  the same instance of data, use the same value of key_str for\n  encryption with AES_ENCRYPT() and decryption with AES_DECRYPT().\n\n  If you are using a KDF, key_str can be any arbitrary information such\n  as a password or passphrase. In the further arguments for the\n  function, you specify the KDF name, then add further options to\n  increase the security as appropriate for the KDF.\n\n  When you use a KDF, the function creates a cryptographically strong\n  secret key from the information passed in key_str and any salt or\n  additional information that you provide in the other arguments. The\n  derived key is used to encrypt and decrypt the data, and it remains\n  in the MySQL Server instance and is not accessible to users. Using a\n  KDF is highly recommended, as it provides better security than\n  specifying your own premade key or deriving it by a simpler method as\n  you use the function.\n\n  If you are not using a KDF, for a key length of 128 bits, the most\n  secure way to pass a key to the key_str argument is to create a truly\n  random 128-bit value and pass it as a binary value. For example:\n\nINSERT INTO t\nVALUES (1,AES_ENCRYPT(\'text\',UNHEX(\'F3229A0B371ED2D9441B830D21A390C3\')));\n\n  A passphrase can be used to generate an AES key by hashing the\n  passphrase. For example:\n\nINSERT INTO t\nVALUES (1,AES_ENCRYPT(\'text\', UNHEX(SHA2(\'My secret passphrase\',512))));\n\n  If you exceed the maximum key length of 128 bits, a warning is\n  returned. If you are not using a KDF, do not pass a password or\n  passphrase directly to key_str, hash it first. Previous versions of\n  this documentation suggested the former approach, but it is no longer\n  recommended as the examples shown here are more secure.\n\no init_vector\n\n  An initialization vector, for block encryption modes that require it.\n  The block_encryption_mode system variable controls the mode. For the\n  same instance of data, use the same value of init_vector for\n  encryption with AES_ENCRYPT() and decryption with AES_DECRYPT().\n\n  *Note*:\n\n  If you are using a KDF, you must specify an initialization vector or\n  a null string for this argument, in order to access the later\n  arguments to define the KDF.\n\n  For modes that require an initialization vector, it must be 16 bytes\n  or longer (bytes in excess of 16 are ignored). An error occurs if\n  init_vector is missing. For modes that do not require an\n  initialization vector, it is ignored and a warning is generated if\n  init_vector is specified, unless you are using a KDF.\n\n  The default value for the block_encryption_mode system variable is\n  aes-128-ecb, or ECB mode, which does not require an initialization\n  vector. The alternative permitted block encryption modes CBC, CFB1,\n  CFB8, CFB128, and OFB all require an initialization vector.\n\n  A random string of bytes to use for the initialization vector can be\n  produced by calling RANDOM_BYTES(16).\n\no kdf_name\n\n  The name of the key derivation function (KDF) to create a key from\n  the input keying material passed in key_str, and other arguments as\n  appropriate for the KDF. Optional.\n\n  For the same instance of data, use the same value of kdf_name for\n  encryption with AES_ENCRYPT() and decryption with AES_DECRYPT(). When\n  you specify kdf_name, you must specify init_vector, using either a\n  valid initialization vector, or a null string if the encryption mode\n  does not require an initialization vector.\n\n  The following values are supported:\n\n  o hkdf\n\n    HKDF, which is available from OpenSSL 1.1.0. HKDF extracts a\n    pseudorandom key from the keying material then expands it into\n    additional keys. With HKDF, you can specify an optional salt (salt)\n    and context-specific information such as application details (info)\n    to include in the keying material.\n\n  o pbkdf2_hmac\n\n    PBKDF2, which is available from OpenSSL 1.0.2. PBKDF2 applies a\n    pseudorandom function to the keying material, and repeats this\n    process a large number of times to produce the key. With PBKDF2,\n    you can specify an optional salt (salt) to include in the keying\n    material, and set the number of iterations used to produce the key\n    (iterations).\n\n  In this example, HKDF is specified as the key derivation function,\n  and a salt and context information are provided. The argument for the\n  initialization vector is included but is the empty string:\n\nSELECT AES_ENCRYPT(\'mytext\',\'mykeystring\', \'\', \'hkdf\', \'salt\', \'info\');\n\n  In this example, PBKDF2 is specified as the key derivation function,\n  a salt is provided, and the number of iterations is doubled from the\n  recommended minimum:\n\nSELECT AES_ENCRYPT(\'mytext\',\'mykeystring\', \'\', \'pbkdf2_hmac\',\'salt\', \'2000\');\n\no salt\n\n  A salt to be passed to the key derivation function (KDF). Optional.\n  Both HKDF and PBKDF2 can use salts, and their use is recommended to\n  help prevent attacks based on dictionaries of common passwords or\n  rainbow tables.\n\n  A salt consists of random data, which for security must be different\n  for each encryption operation. A random string of bytes to use for\n  the salt can be produced by calling RANDOM_BYTES(). This example\n  produces a 64-bit salt:\n\nSET @salt = RANDOM_BYTES(8);\n\n  For the same instance of data, use the same value of salt for\n  encryption with AES_ENCRYPT() and decryption with AES_DECRYPT(). The\n  salt can safely be stored along with the encrypted data.\n\no info\n\n  Context-specific information for HKDF to include in the keying\n  material, such as information about the application. Optional;\n  available when you specify hkdf as the KDF name. HKDF adds this\n  information to the keying material specified in key_str and the salt\n  specified in salt to produce the key.\n\n  For the same instance of data, use the same value of info for\n  encryption with AES_ENCRYPT() and decryption with AES_DECRYPT().\n\no iterations\n\n  The iteration count for PBKDF2 to use when producing the key.\n  Optional; available when you specify pbkdf2_hmac as the KDF name. A\n  higher count gives greater resistance to brute-force attacks because\n  it has a greater computational cost for the attacker, but the same is\n  necessarily true for the key derivation process. The default if you\n  do not specify this argument is 1000, which is the minimum\n  recommended by the OpenSSL standard.\n\n  For the same instance of data, use the same value of iterations for\n  encryption with AES_ENCRYPT() and decryption with AES_DECRYPT().\n\nURL: https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.4/en/encryption-functions.html\n\n','mysql> SET block_encryption_mode = \'aes-256-cbc\';\nmysql> SET @key_str = SHA2(\'My secret passphrase\',512);\nmysql> SET @init_vector = RANDOM_BYTES(16);\nmysql> SET @crypt_str = AES_ENCRYPT(\'text\',@key_str,@init_vector);\nmysql> SELECT CAST(AES_DECRYPT(@crypt_str,@key_str,@init_vector) AS CHAR);\n+-------------------------------------------------------------+\n| CAST(AES_DECRYPT(@crypt_str,@key_str,@init_vector) AS CHAR) |\n+-------------------------------------------------------------+\n| text                                                        |\n+-------------------------------------------------------------+\n','https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.4/en/encryption-functions.html'),(255,'COMPRESS',19,'Syntax:\nCOMPRESS(string_to_compress)\n\nCompresses a string and returns the result as a binary string.

For example, suppose that you execute these\nstatements:\n\nSELECT GET_LOCK(\'lock1\',10);\nSELECT GET_LOCK(\'lock2\',10);\nSELECT RELEASE_LOCK(\'lock2\');\nSELECT RELEASE_LOCK(\'lock1\');\n\nThe second GET_LOCK() acquires a second lock and both RELEASE_LOCK()\ncalls return 1 (success).\n\nIt is even possible for a given session to acquire multiple locks for\nthe same name. Other sessions cannot acquire a lock with that name\nuntil the acquiring session releases all its locks for the name.\n\nUniquely named locks acquired with GET_LOCK() appear in the Performance\nSchema metadata_locks table. The OBJECT_TYPE column says USER LEVEL\nLOCK and the OBJECT_NAME column indicates the lock name. In the case\nthat multiple locks are acquired for the same name, only the first lock\nfor the name registers a row in the metadata_locks table. Subsequent\nlocks for the name increment a counter in the lock but do not acquire\nadditional metadata locks. The metadata_locks row for the lock is\ndeleted when the last lock instance on the name is released.\n\nThe capability of acquiring multiple locks means there is the\npossibility of deadlock among clients. When this happens, the server\nchooses a caller and terminates its lock-acquisition request with an\nER_USER_LOCK_DEADLOCK\n(https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-errors/8.4/en/server-error-reference.html\n#error_er_user_lock_deadlock) error. This error does not cause\ntransactions to roll back.\n\nMySQL enforces a maximum length on lock names of 64 characters.\n\nGET_LOCK() can be used to implement application locks or to simulate\nrecord locks. Names are locked on a server-wide basis. If a name has\nbeen locked within one session, GET_LOCK() blocks any request by\nanother session for a lock with the same name. This enables clients\nthat agree on a given lock name to use the name to perform cooperative\nadvisory locking. But be aware that it also enables a client that is\nnot among the set of cooperating clients to lock a name, either\ninadvertently or deliberately, and thus prevent any of the cooperating\nclients from locking that name. One way to reduce the likelihood of\nthis is to use lock names that are database-specific or\napplication-specific. For example, use lock names of the form\ndb_name.str or app_name.str.\n\nURL: https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.4/en/locking-functions.html\n\n','','https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.4/en/locking-functions.html'),(266,'IS_FREE_LOCK',20,'Syntax:\nIS_FREE_LOCK(str)\n\nChecks whether the lock named str is free to use (that is, not locked).\nReturns 1 if the lock is free (no one is using the lock), 0 if the lock\nis in use, and NULL if an error occurs (such as an incorrect argument).\n\nURL: https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.4/en/locking-functions.html\n\n','','https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.4/en/locking-functions.html'),(267,'IS_USED_LOCK',20,'Syntax:\nIS_USED_LOCK(str)\n\nChecks whether the lock named str is in use (that is, locked).
