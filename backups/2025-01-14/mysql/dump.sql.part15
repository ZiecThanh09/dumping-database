ew invocation time. The WITH CHECK\nOPTION clause can be given to constrain inserts or updates to rows in\ntables referenced by the view. These clauses are described later in\nthis section.\n\nThe CREATE VIEW statement requires the CREATE VIEW privilege for the\nview, and some privilege for each column selected by the SELECT\nstatement. For columns used elsewhere in the SELECT statement, you must\nhave the SELECT privilege. If the OR REPLACE clause is present, you\nmust also have the DROP privilege for the view. If the DEFINER clause\nis present, the privileges required depend on the user value, as\ndiscussed in\nhttps://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.4/en/stored-objects-security.html.\n\nWhen a view is referenced, privilege checking occurs as described later\nin this section.\n\nA view belongs to a database. By default, a new view is created in the\ndefault database. To create the view explicitly in a given database,\nuse db_name.view_name syntax to qualify the view name with the database\nname:\n\nCREATE VIEW test.v AS SELECT * FROM t;\n\nUnqualified table or view names in the SELECT statement are also\ninterpreted with respect to the default database. A view can refer to\ntables or views in other databases by qualifying the table or view name\nwith the appropriate database name.\n\nWithin a database, base tables and views share the same namespace, so a\nbase table and a view cannot have the same name.\n\nColumns retrieved by the SELECT statement can be simple references to\ntable columns, or expressions that use functions, constant values,\noperators, and so forth.\n\nA view must have unique column names with no duplicates, just like a\nbase table. By default, the names of the columns retrieved by the\nSELECT statement are used for the view column names. To define explicit\nnames for the view columns, specify the optional column_list clause as\na list of comma-separated identifiers. The number of names in\ncolumn_list must be the same as the number of columns retrieved by the\nSELECT statement.\n\nA view can be created from many kinds of SELECT statements. It can\nrefer to base tables or other views. It can use joins, UNION, and\nsubqueries. The SELECT need not even refer to any tables:\n\nCREATE VIEW v_today (today) AS SELECT CURRENT_DATE;\n\nThe following example defines a view that selects two columns from\nanother table as well as an expression calculated from those columns:\n\nmysql> CREATE TABLE t (qty INT, price INT);\nmysql> INSERT INTO t VALUES(3, 50);\nmysql> CREATE VIEW v AS SELECT qty, price, qty*price AS value FROM t;\nmysql> SELECT * FROM v;\n+------+-------+-------+\n| qty  | price | value |\n+------+-------+-------+\n|    3 |    50 |   150 |\n+------+-------+-------+\n\nA view definition is subject to the following restrictions:\n\no The SELECT statement cannot refer to system variables or user-defined\n  variables.\n\no Within a stored program, the SELECT statement cannot refer to program\n  parameters or local variables.\n\no The SELECT statement cannot refer to prepared statement parameters.\n\no Any table or view referred to in the definition must exist. If, after\n  the view has been created, a table or view that the definition refers\n  to is dropped, use of the view results in an error. To check a view\n  definition for problems of this kind, use the CHECK TABLE statement.\n\no The definition cannot refer to a TEMPORARY table, and you cannot\n  create a TEMPORARY view.\n\no You cannot associate a trigger with a view.\n\no Aliases for column names in the SELECT statement are checked against\n  the maximum column length of 64 characters (not the maximum alias\n  length of 256 characters).\n\nORDER BY is permitted in a view definition, but it is ignored if you\nselect from a view using a statement that has its own ORDER BY.\n\nFor other options or clauses in the definition, they are added to the\noptions or clauses of the statement that references the view, but the\neffect is undefined. For example, if a view definition includes a LIMIT\nclause, and you select from the view using a statement that has its own\nLIMIT clause, it is undefined which limit applies. This same principle\napplies to options such as ALL, DISTINCT, or SQL_SMALL_RESULT that\nfollow the SELECT keyword, and to clauses such as INTO, FOR UPDATE, FOR\nSHARE, LOCK IN SHARE MODE, and PROCEDURE.\n\nThe results obtained from a view may be affected if you change the\nquery processing environment by changing system variables:\n\nmysql> CREATE VIEW v (mycol) AS SELECT \'abc\';\nQuery OK, 0 rows affected (0.01 sec)\n\nmysql> SET sql_mode = \'\';\nQuery OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)\n\nmysql> SELECT \"mycol\" FROM v;\n+-------+\n| mycol |\n+-------+\n| mycol |\n+-------+\n1 row in set (0.01 sec)\n\nmysql> SET sql_mode = \'ANSI_QUOTES\';\nQuery OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)\n\nmysql> SELECT \"mycol\" FROM v;\n+-------+\n| mycol |\n+-------+\n| abc   |\n+-------+\n1 row in set (0.00 sec)\n\nThe DEFINER and SQL SECURITY clauses determine which MySQL account to\nuse when checking access privileges for the view when a statement is\nexecuted that references the view. The valid SQL SECURITY\ncharacteristic values are DEFINER (the default) and INVOKER. These\nindicate that the required privileges must be held by the user who\ndefined or invoked the view, respectively.\n\nIf the DEFINER clause is present, the user value should be a MySQL\naccount specified as \'user_name\'@\'host_name\', CURRENT_USER, or\nCURRENT_USER(). The permitted user values depend on the privileges you\nhold, as discussed in\nhttps://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.4/en/stored-objects-security.html.\nAlso see that section for additional information about view security.\n\nIf the DEFINER clause is omitted, the default definer is the user who\nexecutes the CREATE VIEW statement. This is the same as specifying\nDEFINER = CURRENT_USER explicitly.\n\nWithin a view definition, the CURRENT_USER function returns the view\'s\nDEFINER value by default. For views defined with the SQL SECURITY\nINVOKER characteristic, CURRENT_USER returns the account for the view\'s\ninvoker. For information about user auditing within views, see\nhttps://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.4/en/account-activity-auditing.html.\n\nWithin a stored routine that is defined with the SQL SECURITY DEFINER\ncharacteristic, CURRENT_USER returns the routine\'s DEFINER value. This\nalso affects a view defined within such a routine, if the view\ndefinition contains a DEFINER value of CURRENT_USER.\n\nMySQL checks view privileges like this:\n\no At view definition time, the view creator must have the privileges\n  needed to use the top-level objects accessed by the view. For\n  example, if the view definition refers to table columns, the creator\n  must have some privilege for each column in the select list of the\n  definition, and the SELECT privilege for each column used elsewhere\n  in the definition. If the definition refers to a stored function,\n  only the privileges needed to invoke the function can be checked. The\n  privileges required at function invocation time can be checked only\n  as it executes: For different invocations, different execution paths\n  within the function might be taken.\n\no The user who references a view must have appropriate privileges to\n  access it (SELECT to select from it, INSERT to insert into it, and so\n  forth.)\n\no When a view has been referenced, privileges for objects accessed by\n  the view are checked against the privileges held by the view DEFINER\n  account or invoker, depending on whether the SQL SECURITY\n  characteristic is DEFINER or INVOKER, respectively.\n\no If reference to a view causes execution of a stored function,\n  privilege checking for statements executed within the function depend\n  on whether the function SQL SECURITY characteristic is DEFINER or\n  INVOKER. If the security characteristic is DEFINER, the function runs\n  with the privileges of the DEFINER account. If the characteristic is\n  INVOKER, the function runs with the privileges determined by the\n  view\'s SQL SECURITY characteristic.\n\nExample: A view might depend on a stored function, and that function\nmight invoke other stored routines. For example, the following view\ninvokes a stored function f():\n\nCREATE VIEW v AS SELECT * FROM t WHERE t.id = f(t.name);\n\nSuppose that f() contains a statement such as this:\n\nIF name IS NULL then\n  CALL p1();\nELSE\n  CALL p2();\nEND IF;\n\nThe privileges required for executing statements within f() need to be\nchecked when f() executes. This might mean that privileges are needed\nfor p1() or p2(), depending on the execution path within f(). Those\nprivileges must be checked at runtime, and the user who must possess\nthe privileges is determined by the SQL SECURITY values of the view v\nand the function f().\n\nThe DEFINER and SQL SECURITY clauses for views are extensions to\nstandard SQL. In standard SQL, views are handled using the rules for\nSQL SECURITY DEFINER. The standard says that the definer of the view,\nwhich is the same as the owner of the view\'s schema, gets applicable\nprivileges on the view (for example, SELECT) and may grant them. MySQL\nhas no concept of a schema \"owner\", so MySQL adds a clause to identify\nthe definer. The DEFINER clause is an extension where the intent is to\nhave what the standard has; that is, a permanent record of who defined\nthe view. This is why the default DEFINER value is the account of the\nview creator.\n\nThe optional ALGORITHM clause is a MySQL extension to standard SQL. It\naffects how MySQL processes the view. ALGORITHM takes three values:\nMERGE, TEMPTABLE, or UNDEFINED. For more information, see\nhttps://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.4/en/view-algorithms.html, as well\nas\nhttps://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.4/en/derived-table-optimization.html\n.\n\nSome views are updatable. That is, you can use them in statements such\nas UPDATE, DELETE, or INSERT to update the contents of the underlying\ntable. For a view to be updatable, there must be a one-to-one\nrelationship between the rows in the view and the rows in the\nunderlying table. There are also certain other constructs that make a\nview nonupdatable.\n\nA generated column in a view is considered updatable because it is\npossible to assign to it. However, if such a column is updated\nexplicitly, the only permitted value is DEFAULT. For information about\ngenerated columns, see\nhttps://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.4/en/create-table-generated-columns.\nhtml.\n\nThe WITH CHECK OPTION clause can be given for an updatable view to\nprevent inserts or updates to rows except those for which the WHERE\nclause in the select_statement is true.\n\nIn a WITH CHECK OPTION clause for an updatable view, the LOCAL and\nCASCADED keywords determine the scope of check testing when the view is\ndefined in terms of another view. The LOCAL keyword restricts the CHECK\nOPTION only to the view being defined. CASCADED causes the checks for\nunderlying views to be evaluated as well. When neither keyword is\ngiven, the default is CASCADED.\n\nFor more information about updatable views and the WITH CHECK OPTION\nclause, see\nhttps://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.4/en/view-updatability.html, and\nhttps://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.4/en/view-check-option.html.\n\nURL: https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.4/en/create-view.html\n\n','','https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.4/en/create-view.html'),(526,'DROP DATABASE',40,'Syntax:\nDROP {DATABASE | SCHEMA} [IF EXISTS] db_name\n\nDROP DATABASE drops all tables in the database and deletes the\ndatabase.

For example, this is permitted:\n\nLOCK TABLE old_table1 WRITE;\nRENAME TABLE old_table1 TO new_table1,\n             new_table1 TO new_table2;\n\nThis is not permitted:\n\nLOCK TABLE old_table1 READ;\nRENAME TABLE old_table1 TO new_table1,\n             new_table1 TO new_table2;\n\nWith the transaction table locking conditions satisfied, the rename\noperation is done atomically; no other session can access any of the\ntables while the rename is in progress.\n\nIf any errors occur during a RENAME TABLE, the statement fails and no\nchanges are made.\n\nYou can use RENAME TABLE to move a table from one database to another:\n\nRENAME TABLE current_db.tbl_name TO other_db.tbl_name;\n\nUsing this method to move all tables from one database to a different\none in effect renames the database (an operation for which MySQL has no\nsingle statement), except that the original database continues to\nexist, albeit with no tables.\n\nLike RENAME TABLE, ALTER TABLE ... RENAME can also be used to move a\ntable to a different database. Regardless of the statement used, if the\nrename operation would move the table to a database located on a\ndifferent file system, the success of the outcome is platform specific\nand depends on the underlying operating system calls used to move table\nfiles.\n\nIf a table has triggers, attempts to rename the table into a different\ndatabase fail with a Trigger in wrong schema (ER_TRG_IN_WRONG_SCHEMA\n(https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-errors/8.4/en/server-error-reference.html\n#error_er_trg_in_wrong_schema)) error.\n\nAn unencrypted table can be moved to an encryption-enabled database and\nvice versa. However, if the table_encryption_privilege_check variable\nis enabled, the TABLE_ENCRYPTION_ADMIN privilege is required if the\ntable encryption setting differs from the default database encryption.\n\nTo rename TEMPORARY tables, RENAME TABLE does not work. Use ALTER TABLE\ninstead.\n\nRENAME TABLE works for views, except that views cannot be renamed into\na different database.\n\nAny privileges granted specifically for a renamed table or view are not\nmigrated to the new name. They must be changed manually.\n\nRENAME TABLE tbl_name TO new_tbl_name changes internally generated\nforeign key constraint names and user-defined foreign key constraint\nnames that begin with the string \"tbl_name_ibfk_\" to reflect the new\ntable name. InnoDB interprets foreign key constraint names that begin\nwith the string \"tbl_name_ibfk_\" as internally generated names.\n\nForeign key constraint names that point to the renamed table are\nautomatically updated unless there is a conflict, in which case the\nstatement fails with an error. A conflict occurs if the renamed\nconstraint name already exists. In such cases, you must drop and\nre-create the foreign keys for them to function properly.\n\nRENAME TABLE tbl_name TO new_tbl_name changes internally generated and\nuser-defined CHECK constraint names that begin with the string\n\"tbl_name_chk_\" to reflect the new table name. MySQL interprets CHECK\nconstraint names that begin with the string \"tbl_name_chk_\" as\ninternally generated names.

It requires the DROP\nprivilege. Logically, TRUNCATE TABLE is similar to a DELETE statement\nthat deletes all rows, or a sequence of DROP TABLE and CREATE TABLE\nstatements.\n\nTo achieve high performance, TRUNCATE TABLE bypasses the DML method of\ndeleting data. Thus, it does not cause ON DELETE triggers to fire, it\ncannot be performed for InnoDB tables with parent-child foreign key\nrelationships, and it cannot be rolled back like a DML operation.\nHowever, TRUNCATE TABLE operations on tables that use an atomic\nDDL-supported storage engine are either fully committed or rolled back\nif the server halts during their operation. For more information, see\nhttps://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.4/en/atomic-ddl.html.\n\nAlthough TRUNCATE TABLE is similar to DELETE, it is classified as a DDL\nstatement rather than a DML statement. It differs from DELETE in the\nfollowing ways:\n\no Truncate operations drop and re-create the table, which is much\n  faster than deleting rows one by one, particularly for large tables.\n\no Truncate operations cause an implicit commit, and so cannot be rolled\n  back. See\n  https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.4/en/implicit-commit.html.\n\no Truncation operations cannot be performed if the session holds an\n  active table lock.\n\no TRUNCATE TABLE fails for an InnoDB table or NDB table if there are\n  any FOREIGN KEY constraints from other tables that reference the\n  table. Foreign key constraints between columns of the same table are\n  permitted.\n\no Truncation operations do not return a meaningful value for the number\n  of deleted rows. The usual result is \"0 rows affected,\" which should\n  be interpreted as \"no information.\"\n\no As long as the table definition is valid, the table can be re-created\n  as an empty table with TRUNCATE TABLE, even if the data or index\n  files have become corrupted.\n\no Any AUTO_INCREMENT value is reset to its start value. This is true\n  even for MyISAM and InnoDB, which normally do not reuse sequence\n  values.\n\no When used with partitioned tables, TRUNCATE TABLE preserves the\n  partitioning; that is, the data and index files are dropped and\n  re-created, while the partition definitions are unaffected.\n\no The TRUNCATE TABLE statement does not invoke ON DELETE triggers.\n\no Truncating a corrupted InnoDB table is supported.\n\nTRUNCATE TABLE is treated for purposes of binary logging and\nreplication as DDL rather than DML, and is always logged as a\nstatement.\n\nURL: https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.4/en/truncate-table.html\n\n','','https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.4/en/truncate-table.html'),(540,'CALL',41,'Syntax:\nCALL sp_name([parameter[,...]])\nCALL sp_name[()]\n\nThe CALL statement invokes a stored procedure that was defined\npreviously with CREATE PROCEDURE.\n\nStored procedures that take no arguments can be invoked without\nparentheses.

To check the number of deleted rows, call the\nROW_COUNT() function described in\nhttps://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.4/en/information-functions.html.\n\nMain Clauses\n\nThe conditions in the optional WHERE clause identify which rows to\ndelete. With no WHERE clause, all rows are deleted.\n\nwhere_condition is an expression that evaluates to true for each row to\nbe deleted. It is specified as described in\nhttps://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.4/en/select.html.\n\nIf the ORDER BY clause is specified, the rows are deleted in the order\nthat is specified. The LIMIT clause places a limit on the number of\nrows that can be deleted. These clauses apply to single-table deletes,\nbut not multi-table deletes.\n\nMultiple-Table Syntax\n\nDELETE [LOW_PRIORITY] [QUICK] [IGNORE]\n    tbl_name[.*] [, tbl_name[.*]] ...\n    FROM table_references\n    [WHERE where_condition]\n\nDELETE [LOW_PRIORITY] [QUICK] [IGNORE]\n    FROM tbl_name[.*] [, tbl_name[.*]] ...\n    USING table_references\n    [WHERE where_condition]\n\nPrivileges\n\nYou need the DELETE privilege on a table to delete rows from it. You\nneed only the SELECT privilege for any columns that are only read, such\nas those named in the WHERE clause.\n\nPerformance\n\nWhen you do not need to know the number of deleted rows, the TRUNCATE\nTABLE statement is a faster way to empty a table than a DELETE\nstatement with no WHERE clause. Unlike DELETE, TRUNCATE TABLE cannot be\nused within a transaction or if you have a lock on the table. See [HELP\nTRUNCATE TABLE] and [HELP LOCK TABLES].\n\nThe speed of delete operations may also be affected by factors\ndiscussed in\nhttps://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.4/en/delete-optimization.html.\n\nTo ensure that a given DELETE statement does not take too much time,\nthe MySQL-specific LIMIT row_count clause for DELETE specifies the\nmaximum number of rows to be deleted. If the number of rows to delete\nis larger than the limit, repeat the DELETE statement until the number\nof affected rows is less than the LIMIT value.\n\nSubqueries\n\nYou cannot delete from a table and select from the same table in a\nsubquery.\n\nPartitioned Table Support\n\nDELETE supports explicit partition selection using the PARTITION\nclause, which takes a list of the comma-separated names of one or more\npartitions or subpartitions (or both) from which to select rows to be\ndropped. Partitions not included in the list are ignored. Given a\npartitioned table t with a partition named p0, executing the statement\nDELETE FROM t PARTITION (p0) has the same effect on the table as\nexecuting ALTER TABLE t TRUNCATE PARTITION (p0); in both cases, all\nrows in partition p0 are dropped.\n\nPARTITION can be used along with a WHERE condition, in which case the\ncondition is tested only on rows in the listed partitions. For example,\nDELETE FROM t PARTITION (p0) WHERE c < 5 deletes rows only from\npartition p0 for which the condition c < 5 is true; rows in any other\npartitions are not checked and thus not affected by the DELETE.\n\nThe PARTITION clause can also be used in multiple-table DELETE\nstatements. You can use up to one such option per table named in the\nFROM option.\n\nFor more information and examples, see\nhttps://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.4/en/partitioning-selection.html.\n\nURL: https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.4/en/delete.html\n\n','','https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.4/en/delete.html'),(542,'DO',41,'Syntax:\nDO expr [, expr] ...\n\nDO executes the expressions but does not return any results.

For example, the\n    .sdi files for the employees and managers tables might be named\n    employees_125.sdi and managers_238.sdi.\n\n  o For a MyISAM table, the content files are its .MYD data file and\n    .MYI index file.\n\n   Given those file names, the copy commands look like this:\n\n$> cd export_basedir/data/hr\n$> cp employees_125.sdi /tmp/export\n$> cp managers_238.sdi /tmp/export\n$> cp employees.{MYD,MYI} /tmp/export\n$> cp managers.{MYD,MYI} /tmp/export\n\n3.

If the .sdi file is placed in that\ndirectory, however, it may be rewritten; the import operation creates a\nnew .sdi file for the table, which overwrites the old .sdi file if the\noperation uses the same file name for the new file.\n\nEach sdi_file value must be a string literal that names the .sdi file\nfor a table or is a pattern that matches .sdi files. If the string is a\npattern, any leading directory path and the .sdi file name suffix must\nbe given literally. Pattern characters are permitted only in the base\nname part of the file name:\n\no ? matches any single character\n\no * matches any sequence of characters, including no characters\n\nUsing a pattern, the previous IMPORT TABLE statement could have been\nwritten like this (assuming that the /tmp/mysql-files directory\ncontains no other .sdi files matching the pattern):\n\nIMPORT TABLE FROM \'/tmp/mysql-files/*.sdi\';\n\nTo interpret the location of .sdi file path names, the server uses the\nsame rules for IMPORT TABLE as the server-side rules for LOAD DATA\n(that is, the non-LOCAL rules).
